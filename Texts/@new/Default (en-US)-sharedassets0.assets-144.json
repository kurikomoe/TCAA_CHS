        "You wonder what their discussion was about.",
        "Flinhart McCoy: …What’s this?[p/] Some kind of game?",
        "Ms. Tymora glances at pieces on the board.",
        "Ruby Tymora: ...Don’t feel [i]too[/i] bad about losing to him.[p/] He’s nationally ranked.",
        "Celeste McCoy: Oh,[p/] you're a professional.[p/] Is that why you’re wearing a suit?",
        "Tyrion Cuthbert: No…[p/] Chess is just a hobby.[p/] I’m actually a defense attorney.",
        "Celeste McCoy: …An attorney?",
        "Ruby Tymora: Speaking of which,[p/] we should probably be on our way.",
        "Flinhart McCoy: Aye…[p/] Sorry for refusing you after you came all this way.",
        "Flinhart McCoy: I really respect what you're doing.",
        "Flinhart McCoy: But I don't want anything to do with your mage friends.",
        "Celeste McCoy: …",
        "You wonder what he meant by that.",
        "Was Ms. Tymora trying to introduce him to one of our clients?",
        "Celeste McCoy: A-[p/][s/]Anyways,[p/] it [i]is[/i] getting late.",
        "Celeste McCoy: If you leave now,[p/] you won't get back to the city until morning.",
        "Flinhart McCoy: Mm…[p/] She’s right.[p/]",
        "Flinhart McCoy: This region is littered with bandits and brigands.",
        "Flinhart: You wouldn't want to run into them this late.",
        "Ruby Tymora: …I guess you have a point.",
        "Flinhart McCoy: We have plenty of empty rooms that you can stay in until morning.",
        "Flinhart McCoy: …It’s the least I can do after you came all this way.",
        "Ruby: Well,[p/] if it's not too much trouble,[p/] we might as well stay here until tomorrow.",
        "Celeste McCoy: The tavern is shut down.[p/] But we still have some sheets and blankets.",
        "Celeste McCoy: I’ll go get the rooms ready!",
        "Celeste and Flinhart leave the dining area to get your rooms ready.",
        "You’re left in the dining room with Ms. Tymora.",
        "Tyrion Cuthbert: So…[p/] I take it that negotiations didn’t go well?",
        "Ruby Tymora: No... [p/]I didn't expect him to be so stubborn.",
        "Ruby Tymora: Honestly,[p/] I have no idea what that man has against mages.",
        "Tyrion Cuthbert: Well... [p/]There [i]is[/i] one way to find out.",
        "Ruby Tymora: ...",
        "Tyrion: ...Why are you being so secretive?",
        "Tyrion: If your business with Flinhart is related to our clients, [p/]I can help.",
        "Ruby: ...It wasn't important. [p/]And your presence was [i]not[/i] necessary.",
        "That's such an obvious lie.[p/] But you can’t read a single thought from her mind.",

        "Celeste: Um…",
        "Celeste enthusiastically came back downstairs.",

        "Celeste: S-[p/]Sorry to interrupt,[p/] but your rooms are ready now.",
        "Ruby: ...Right.",
        "Tyrion: ...Thank you.",
        "An awkward silence hangs in the air as you and Ms. Tymora head upstairs.",
        "You reach the upper hallway,[p/] and see the two rooms that Celeste prepared for you.",
        "Ruby: …",
        "Ms. Tymora stops before entering her room.",
        "Ruby: ...",
        "Ruby: You were playing chess with Flinhart's daughter earlier. [p/]Was she any good?",
        "Tyrion: …Not at first.[p/] But she got a lot better as we kept playing.",
        "Ruby: ...I'm sorry for leaving you there for so long.[p/] I didn't expect our discussion to last that long.",
        "Tyrion: No...[p/] It's fine.[p/] Despite everything,[p/] I enjoyed playing against her.",
        "Ruby: ...I see.",
        "Ruby: Well...[p/] I suppose you [i]are[/i] at that age.",
        "Tyrion: N-[p/][s/]No![p/][s/] It’s not like that!",
        "Tyrion: It's just that outside of tournaments,[p/] I never really get to play against another player…",
        "Tyrion: And [i]you[/i] only ever want to play Shogi against me.",
        "Ruby: Because Shogi is clearly superior.",
        "Tyrion: It’s complete anarchy,[p/][s/] is what it is!",
        "Tyrion: You just bring fallen pieces back to life like some kind of necromancer!",
        "Ruby: It adds depth.[p/][s/] Dropping adds a dimension of play that isn't present in chess!",
        "You sternly look at each other,[p/] your positions already made.",
        "After a few moments of silence,[p/] you both burst out laughing.",
        "Ruby: …",
        "Ruby: I’m sorry if it looks like I don't trust you.[p/] I know you're just trying to help.",
        "Ruby: But there are some things about my work that I just can’t tell you about yet.",
        "Ruby: But one day...[p/] I'll tell you everything.",
        "Tyrion: Right…[p/] I’m sorry for prying.",
        "Tyrion: I just...[p/] want to show you I’m ready to be an attorney.",
        "Ruby: You are.[p/] I know you are.",
        "The rare praise from your mentor catches you off guard.",
        "Ruby: A-[p/]Anyways,[p/] get some rest.",

        "Tyrion: R-[p/][s/]Right...",
        "You completely forgot about the carriage ride back.",
        "You can already feel your stomach churning in protest.",

        "And as you close your eyes,[p/] you slowly drift into a deep slumber.",
        "...As this happens,[p/] you feel something…[p/] invasive.",

        "Flinhart: I WANT YOU OUT OF MY HOUSE![p/][s/] OUT!",
        "A dead silence lingers in the air before you hear someone rush out of the tavern.",

        "Garrick: If you stop spreading dissidence,[p/] no harm will come to you or your family.",

        "Upon seeing Celeste,[p/] one of the knights steps forward and grabs her.",
        "Surprisingly,[p/] she’s able to break free from his grip and tries to push further into the tavern.",
        "Noticing the commotion,[p/] three other knights rush to grab her and begin dragging her away.",

        "Celeste: ...But I still don’t understand, though.",
        "Celeste: Why were there traces of magic on my dad’s body?",
        "Right...[p/] Those traces of magic were on the sword [i]and[/i] the body.",
        "Magical traces are particles of magical residue that are left behind when a mage casts a spell.",
        "They only linger around for 48 hours.[p/] And that gives you a rough timeline of when and where a spell is cast.",
        "Tyrion: Did you cast [b]Mage Blade[/b] on your sword that day?",
        "Celeste: I did.[p/] I usually cast it when I train in the morning.",

        "Celeste: Did the trace on my sword leave the magical trace on my dad’s body?",
        "Tyrion: No…[p/] Magical traces can't be moved around physically.",
        "Tyrion: For a spell to leave a trace,[p/] it has to be active when physical contact is made.",
        "Celeste: Really?[p/] What does that mean then?",
        "Tyrion: Whatever killed your father had a [b]transmutation[/b] spell active on it at the time.",

        "Tyrion: If you really wanted to,[p/] you could have gone your whole life without using it.",
        "Celeste: Ever since our tavern closed,[p/] my family’s been in a lot of debt.",
        "Celeste: I decided to become a mercenary and use magic to enhance my ability to fight.",

        "Aria: Oh,[p/] did he now?[p/] Then let me ask [i]you[/i] one question, Mr. Cuthbert.",
        "Aria: If your client didn’t kill Flinhart McCoy…[p/] then who did?",
        "Tyrion: …",
        "Tyrion: How should I know?",
        "Tyrion: If I'm not mistaken,[p/] it's the [i]commander's[/i] job to figure that out.",
        "Aria: Oh,[p/] I’m well aware of the commander’s [i]incompetence[/i].",
        "Aria: But one fact still stands.",
        "Aria: There was magic detected on the wound and the sword.",
        "Aria: Would you like for me to tell you how many mages live in that small town?",
        "You don't like where she's going with this.",
        "Aria: Just one.",
        "Aria: There’s only [i]one[/i] registered mage in that entire town.",
        "Aria: And that mage is your client!",
        "Tyrion: What?!",
        "Aria: The defendant was also established to have been with the victim [i]hours[/i] before his death.",
        "Aria: She was the last known person with him,[p/] [i]and[/i] she was the only mage there.",
        "Aria: In addition to that,[p/] I have several witnesses who heard them arguing.",
        "Tyrion: ...",
        "Aria: [i]How[/i] she murdered the victim is simply an unanswered question.",
        "Judge: Hm…[p/] I see.[p/] That certainly [i]does[/i] change matters.",
        "Judge: I can’t say that the prosecution’s evidence is irrefutable.",
        "Judge: …But there is still evidence that casts guilt upon the defendant.",
        "Damn it![p/][s/] You almost had them!",
        "Judge: There are far too many unanswered questions for me to pass a verdict.",
        "Judge: We will give law enforcement time to clear these unknowns.",
        "Judge: ...I [i]suggest[/i] that they conduct their investigation more thoroughly this time.",
        "Orym: ...",
        "Judge: We will resume the trial tomorrow morning.",
        "Judge: Court is adjourned.",
        "Ruby: Hello, Cuthbert.",
        "As you walk out of the courtroom with Celeste,[p/] you are greeted by Ms. Tymora.",
        "Tyrion: M-[p/][s/]Ms. Tymora?![p/] You’re…[p/][s/] here?!",
        "You recall how you froze up during the first cross-examination.",
        "You feel a little ashamed that your [i]mentor[/i] saw all of that.",
        "Ruby: …",
        "Ruby: Well…[p/] At the end of the day,[p/] you [i]were[/i] able to pull it together.",
        "Ruby: And once you did that,[p/] you performed...[p/] adequately.",
        "Ruby: On that note,[p/] I wanted to give you this.",
        "{0}",
        "{0}",
        "Celeste: My [b]Spell Compendium[/b]?",
        "Ruby: I swiped it from the dining area before the Inquisition arrived.",
        "Ruby: I thought it'd be best for you to have it.",
        "Tyrion: So…[p/] this is your [b]Spell Compendium[/b].",
        "Tyrion: And it only has one spell.",
        "Celeste: [b]Mage Blade[/b]...",
        "Tyrion: This means that the prosecution has to prove that Celeste used that specific spell.",
        "Ruby: It will restrict how they approach this case,[p/] which gives you an edge over them.",
        "Ruby: …But that prosecutor is really something else.",
        "Tyrion: You mean Prosecutor Steelwind?",
        "You can still remember her ripping glare…",
        "It gives you chills just thinking about it.",
        "Ruby: You wouldn’t even know it,[p/] but this was [i]also[/i] her first trial.",
        "Celeste: Really?!",
        "Ruby: I’d thought that her inexperience would make for a good first opponent.",
        "Ruby: But that girl…[p/] she’s a natural in the courtroom.",
        "Ruby: It makes me wonder why a [i]Steelwind[/i] would choose to become an attorney in the first place.",
        "Celeste: What do you mean?",
        "Ruby: The Steelwinds are a powerful noble house.",
        "Ruby: Of the noble families,[p/] they are one of the few who answer directly to the king.",
        "Ruby: Most members of their house take high-ranking positions in the kingdom’s military.",
        "Ruby: So, it’s a bit strange that she chose to become a prosecutor despite that.",
        "Tyrion: “Steelwind”…",
        "Tyrion: I feel like I've heard it somewhere before.",
        "Ruby: In any case,[p/] it’s best that you focus on the trial.",
        "Ruby: You have about a day until court resumes.",
        "Tyrion: Right.[p/] Now that I have time,[p/] I'd like to ask you some questions, Celeste.",
        "Tyrion: …Namely about that argument you had with your father.",
        "Celeste: O-[p/]Oh…",
        "You see the bailiff starring daggers at Celeste.",
        "It looks like they’re waiting to take her back to her cell.",
        "Whatever questions you have for her will have to wait.",
        "Celeste: I-[p/]I should probably go...",
        "Celeste walks away while avoiding eye contact with you.",
        "…Bringing up her argument with Flinhart [i]may[/i] have struck a nerve.",
        "Tyrion: I’ll also use this opportunity to investigate the crime scene.",
        "Tyrion: I wouldn’t be surprised if the Inquisition missed something.",
        "Ruby: You utterly embarrassed them today.",
        "Ruby: Don’t expect them to make the same mistake twice.",
        "Tyrion: Right.[p/] There are still a lot of things we don’t know about.",
        "Ruby: As much as I hate to admit it,[p/] your skills of deduction far surpass mine.",
        "Ruby: If anyone can figure out what really happened that night,[p/] it’s you.",
        "Tyrion: A courtroom…[p/] I’m in a real courtroom.",
        "...Actually [i]entering[/i] the courtroom has taken a lot of wind out of your sails.",
        "You’ve never been here as an attorney before.",
        "You've only ever acted as Ms. Tymora's assistant.",
        "Aria: …",
        "The woman at the prosecutor’s bench is staring at you.",
        "Ms. Tymora mentioned her before you went to see Celeste.",
        "What was her name again?[p/] You think it was \"Aria Steelwind\".",
        "You can feel the coldness of her glare burrowing into you.",
        "Why is she staring you down?[p/] Is she trying to intimidate you?",
        "…Because it’s working!",
        "Judge: Court is now in session for the trial of Celeste McCoy.",
        "Aria: The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.",
        "Tyrion: …Oh,[p/] uh.",
        "Tyrion: T-[p/]The defense is also ready, Your Honor.",
        "Aria: ...He doesn't necessarily [i]sound[/i] very ready.",
        "Judge: ...Regardless,[p/] let’s begin the proceedings.",
        "Judge: Prosecutor Steelwind,[p/] please list the charges.",
        "Aria: The defendant is Celeste McCoy:[p/] a mercenary for hire and a registered mage.",
        "Tyrion: Wait…[p/][s/] Did she just say “mercenary”?!",
        "Celeste: Yeah…[p/] I had to take up a job after my family’s tavern was shut down.",
        "Tyrion: O-[p/]Oh,[p/] right…",
        "That’s not exactly the [i]first[/i] occupation you’d choose...",
        "Aria: She’s charged with second-degree murder and negligent misuse of the Arcane Arts.",
        "Judge: I see...[p/] So there was [i]magic[/i] involved.",
        "Aria: Yes.[p/] The crime occurred within the McCoy tavern:[p/] a local inn that shut down years ago.",
        "Aria: The locals reported hearing a loud commotion coming from within the building.",
        "Aria: Hours later,[p/] a carriage driver that was nearby checked the disturbance.",
        "Aria: It was then that he found the victim,[p/] the defendant’s sword [i]still[/i] impaling his dead body.",
        "Aria: The Inquisition has provided an autopsy report and a record of the sword.",
        "{0}",
        "{0}",
        "Judge: What was the defendant’s relationship with the victim?",
        "Judge: I see that they share the same last name.",
        "Aria: The defendant is the victim’s daughter,[p/] but not by blood.",
        "Aria: She was adopted into the family when she was an infant.[p/] Her birth parents are currently unknown.",
        "Judge: I see…[p/] What a unfortunate turn of events…",
        "Aria: To begin,[p/] the prosecution would like to call Commander Orym White to the stand.",
        "Aria: Witness,[p/] please state your name and occupation for the court.",
        "Orym: Name’s Orym White.[p/] I’m Commander of the Arcane Inquisition.",
        "Aria: Orym,[p/] could you please testify about the details of the Inquisition's investigation?",
        "Orym: Yeah... yeah...",
        "Orym: We got a call late at night.[p/] Someone discovered a dead body inside the McCoy Tavern.",
        "Orym: When we arrived on the scene,[p/] we found Flinhart McCoy dead on the floor.[p/] The defendant’s sword was still inside of him.",
        "Orym: We have several witnesses who heard the victim and defendant in a loud argument before the body was discovered.",
        "Orym: Their argument must have turned ugly.[p/] Because the defendant killed the victim using her magic sword.",
        "Tyrion: ...",
        "Isn’t that really incriminating?!",
        "One of her possessions is the murder weapon!",
        "Judge: Mr. Cuthbert,[p/] you may begin your cross-examination.",
        "Tyrion: U-[p/]Uh...",
        "You open your mouth to respond.[p/] But nothing comes out.",
        "You can't think of anything to say.[p/] Everything is blank.",
        "Judge: …Mr. Cuthbert?",
        "Celeste: Hey![p/][s/] What are you doing?!",
        "Celeste: This is the part where you say something, right?!",
        "Tyrion: I-[p/]I…[p/] I’m sorry,[p/] I don’t-!",
        "Your anxiety is just getting worse.[p/] And your breaths are becoming more and more desperate.",
        "Are you hyperventilating?",
        "Aria: *sigh*[p/] What a disappointment…",
        "Tyrion: ...!",
        "Aria: I was hoping to fight against the infamous Ruby Tymora, today.",
        "Aria: But it’s clear you can’t even hold a candle to her.",
        "Aria: Your Honor.[p/] It’s clear that the defense has nothing to say against the prosecution’s overwhelming evidence.",
        "Orym: Yep.[p/] This case is pretty open and shut.",
        "Tyrion: N-[p/][s/]No![p/][s/] Wait!",
        "This...[p/][s/] This isn't what's supposed to happen!",

        "Ruby: I-[p/]I’m sorry, Tyrion.",
        "Ruby: I…[p/] I couldn’t acquit Frey…",
        "Ruby: She was found guilty.",
        "Tyrion: W-[p/][s/]What..?![p/] B-[p/]But...[p/] that means...",
        "Tyrion: Are they going to execute her?!",
        "No... [p/]Not again...",
        "Are you seriously going to let that happen again?!",
        "Celeste: …",
        "Celeste: Tyrion!",
        "Celeste grabs your shoulders and shakes you out of your panic.",
        "Celeste: You need to calm down.",
        "Her gaze is calm and focused despite the gravity of the situation.[p/] But she looks stern,[p/] not angry.",
        "Tyrion: I-[p/]I’m sorry…[p/] I didn’t mean for this to-",
        "Celeste: Stop.[p/][s/] Just listen to me.",
        "Celeste: You know what to do.[p/] ...Right?",
        "Celeste: Uh…",
        "Celeste: Just…[p/][s/] [i]do[/i] it the same way you play chess!",
        "Tyrion: …What?",
        "Celeste: I don't know![p/][s/] You were just so calm and focused when we were playing [i]before[/i]!",
        "Celeste: No matter how close I got to beating you,[p/] you always knew how to stay calm and win.",
        "Celeste: So just…[p/] channel that feeling and look at the...[p/] pieces?",
        "That doesn't make any sense...[p/] And yet...",
        "Tyrion: ...",
        "You take a moment to focus and let everything else disappear from the world.",
        "Every statement that he made…[p/] Every word that came out of his mouth…",
        "Each of those is a possible weakness that you can attack.",
        "Every bleak moment can be turned around.[p/] You just need to consider every angle.",
        "Tyrion: …",
        "Tyrion: My apologies for the delay, Your Honor.[p/] The defense is ready to begin cross-examining the witness.",
        "Judge: ...Very well.",
        "Aria: Hmph...",
        "Celeste: There we go. [mind=\"Thank god that worked...\"/]",
        "Carefully examine every statement he made and find something that contradicts the evidence in your NOTES.",
        "Once you do that,[p/] PRESENT the contradicting evidence and prove that his testimony is false!",
        "Orym: We got a call late at night. Someone discovered a dead body inside the McCoy Tavern.",
        "Tyrion: At what time exactly did you get this call?[p/] And who discovered the body?",
        "Orym: The call came in at 1:25 AM.",
        "Orym: As for the witness who discovered it…[p/] He wanted to remain incognito.",
        "Hm…[p/] It’s not unusual for a witness to stay anonymous.[p/] It’s well within their right.",
        "But this would be a lot easier if you could question the witness directly.",
        "Aria: What happened when you arrived, Commander?",
        "Orym: When we arrived on the scene,[p/] we found Flinhart McCoy dead on the floor. The defendant’s sword was still inside of him.",
        "Tyrion: How did you know that the sword was my client’s?",
        "Orym: Her sword is made out of some kind of special alloy.",
        "Orym: I think it was forged out of the country or something.",
        "Orym: It’d be hard to mistake something like that.",
        "Aria: We also have several eyewitnesses who verified that the sword belonged to the defendant.",
        "Aria: She made no effort to hide it from the public.",
        "Aria: Quite the contrary,[p/] she was quite [i]proud[/i] to show it off.",
        "Tyrion: But even [i]if[/i] the sword belongs to my client,[p/] that [i]doesn’t[/i] necessarily mean that she was the one who stabbed him.",
        "Orym: Yeah, well…",
        "Orym: We have several witnesses who heard the victim and defendant in a loud argument before the body was discovered.",
        "Tyrion: How did they know it was my client and the victim that were arguing?",
        "Orym: You were there, weren’t you?[p/] You had to have heard them too.",
        "Orym: Every witness we talked to knew it was them.",
        "Tyrion: U-[p/]Uh…[p/] well-",
        "Aria: Your honor,[p/] it’s clear that the defense is playing devil’s advocate.",
        "Aria: Even [i]he[/i] should have recognized their voices.",
        "Tyrion: ...",
        "Well,[p/] they've got you there.",
        "Orym: Their argument must have turned ugly.[p/] Because the defendant killed the victim using her magic sword.",
        "Tyrion: That’s conjecture!",
        "Tyrion: Weren’t there plenty of people around who could have committed the crime?!",
        "Orym: That tavern has been closed for years.",
        "Orym: The defendant, the victim, and Ruby Tymora were the only ones there before the body was discovered.",
        "Orym: Plus,[p/] the murder weapon [i]definitely[/i] belonged to her.",
        "Well, it’s a given that Ms. Tymora didn’t do this. And it’ll be hard to prove that someone [i]else[/i] was at the crime scene…",
        "But you can't help but feel that there’s something off about what he just said.",
        "Player: Overflow",
        "You shouldn’t have panicked so much before.",
        "His testimony [i]is[/i] straightforward…[p/] but that will actually make this easier.",
        "Assuming that Ms. McCoy is innocent,[p/] there has to be a flaw in his logic.",
        "You just need to compare every statement to each piece of evidence in your NOTES.",
        "Once you find a contradiction,[p/] PRESENT that piece of evidence to the contradicting statement.",
        "Player: Objection",
        "Player: Celeste's Sword",
        "Player: Default",
        "Tyrion: Your Honor![p/][s/] It's clear that the witness's testimony is contradictory!",
        "Tyrion: And [i]this[/i] piece of evidence proves it!",
        "Judge: I fail to see how [i]that[/i] proves anything, Mr. Cuthbert...",

        "Ruby: You’re a lot less jumpy than you were yesterday.",
        "Ruby: I’m glad to see that you’re finally getting used to things.",
        "Ruby: So,[p/] what did you find in your investigation?",
        "You tell Ms. Tymora about everything you’ve learned over your investigation.",
        "Ruby: Hm…[p/] There aren’t a lot of clues that point to what [i]actually[/i] happened.",
        "Tyrion: Yeah...[p/] I know a lot of details about the crime scene,[p/] but nothing about the crime itself.",
        "Tyrion: This means I’ll have to rely solely on pointing out contradictions in the witness’s testimonies.",
        "Ruby: Being reactive to the prosecution's moves [i]is[/i] a valid strategy.",
        "Ruby: Honestly,[p/] I think it was a miracle that you got the commander to cooperate with you at all.",
        "Right…[p/] You almost forgot…",
        "Commander White appears to really have it out for Ms. Tymora.",
        "Tyrion: …",

        "Judge: Let us review the proceedings from yesterday.",
        "Judge: Yesterday,[p/] the defense presented some shocking oversights made during the investigation.",
        "Aria: Yes.[p/] I personally saw to it that the investigation was conducted [i]properly[/i] this time.",
        "Judge: I…[p/] see.",
        "Judge: I suppose that puts my mind at ease.",
        "Aria: At yesterday’s trial,[p/] we found an inconsistency between the crime scene photo and the Autopsy Report.",
        "Aria: Because of this,[p/] the defense tried to push the following narrative:",
        "Aria: That a third party [i]must[/i] have interfered with the crime scene to frame the defendant.",
        "Aria: However,[p/] the prosecution has discovered another explanation.",
        "Aria: Because of that,[p/] the individual who discovered the body would like to testify as to what he saw that night.",
        "Aria: His eyewitness account will clear up what actually happened.",
        "Judge: Interesting.[p/] It was my understanding that the individual in question wanted to remain anonymous.",
        "Aria: Supposedly,[p/] this witness was within the gallery of the trial yesterday.",
        "Aria: After yesterday’s proceedings,[p/] he felt that he couldn’t stay silent any longer.",
        "So, [i]that’s[/i] her plan...",
        "But why would the witness change his mind like that?",
        "Did Steelwind persuade him?[p/] …Or is something else happening here?",
        "Judge: Very well.",
        "Judge: Let’s hear from this witness.",
        "Judge: Witness, please state your name and occupation for the court.",
        "Rhys: My name is Rhys Reginald Rudolf.",
        "Rhys: I am a chauffeur of the equine variety.",
        "Judge: I’m terribly sorry…",
        "Judge: But I’m unfamiliar with that…[p/] profession.",
        "Aria: He [i]means[/i] to say that he’s a carriage driver.",
        "Judge: O-[p/]Oh…[p/] I see.",
        "Judge: But in any case,[p/] it is my understanding that you found the body.",
        "Judge: Am I correct, Mr. Rudolf?",
        "Rhys: ...",
        "Rudolf appears to be writing something in a notebook.",
        "He writes with incredible speed.",
        "His pen only touches the paper for maybe a second before he’s filled an entire page.",
        "Judge: …Mr. Rudolf?",
        "Rhys: Ah…[p/] Forgive me.",
        "Rhys: I was merely taking notes on the people in this room.",
        "Judge: “Taking notes”?",
        "Aria: The witness has a certain compulsion to keep a record of every event that he witnesses.",
        "Judge: I…[p/] see.",
        "Judge: Then I assume we will receive an accurate testimony of how you found the body?",
        "Rhys: Actually,[p/] I witnessed much more than that.",
        "Rhys: I saw the crime as it was being committed.",
        "Rhys: And I wrote down everything that I saw.",
        "Tyrion: What?!",
        "Judge: That is quite the claim!",
        "Judge: If that’s true,[p/] why did you choose to remain silent until now?",
        "Aria: We had initially concluded that the evidence alone was decisive enough.",
        "Aria: Therefore,[p/] we saw no need at the time for his testimony.",
        "Aria: …However,[p/] those circumstances clearly changed during yesterday's trial.",
        "There’s no way the prosecution [i]wouldn’t[/i] leverage eyewitness testimony from the start…",
        "Something else is happening here.",
        "Judge: Very well.",
        "Judge: Mr. Rudolf,[p/] please testify to the court about what you saw that night.",
        "Rhys: I was transporting a client in my carriage that evening.",
        "Rhys: We were driving by the McCoy Tavern when we heard a disturbance.[p/] This occurred at 1:28 am.",
        "Rhys: Worried that something was amiss,[p/] I walked into the establishment to see what the commotion was about.",
        "Rhys: There I saw the defendant.[p/] She was lit by the blue glow of the dining room lights.[p/][s/] She had stabbed Flinhart McCoy and was channeling magic into her sword!",
        "Rhys: She removed her sword from Flinhart’s back,[p/] and as he slowly turned to face her,[p/][s/] she stabbed him again in the front!",
        "Rhys: She soon realized that I had witnessed her heinous crime.[p/] She let the body fall to the ground and fled the scene.",
        "Judge: Incredible!",
        "Judge: If everything occurred as the witness described,[p/] then I see no room for debate.",
        "Aria: Of course,[p/] the evidence has [i]always[/i] been irrefutable.",
        "You don’t remember seeing him when you left to look for Celeste.",
        "But it [i]was[/i] pretty dark.",
        "Tyrion: Celeste,[p/] did you see this man that night?",
        "Celeste: No.[p/] This is my first time meeting him.",
        "Celeste: And I didn't see him when I ran out of the tavern that night.",
        "Tyrion: So,[p/] he has to be lying.",
        "Celeste: Does that mean…[p/] [i]He’s[/i] the one who killed my dad?",
        "She tries her best to hide it,[p/] but you can sense her restlessness.",
        "Tyrion: Hm…[p/] It’s hard to say right now.[p/] But it’s definitely a possibility.",
        "Judge: The defense may now begin their cross-examination.",
        "Rhys: I was transporting a client in my carriage that evening.",
        "Tyrion: Who was the passenger in your carriage?",
        "Rhys: Ah…[p/] well-",
        "Aria: The identity of the passenger is irrelevant.",
        "Aria: This [i]witness[/i] is the one who actually observed the crime as it occurred.",
        "Tyrion: If there was another person at the scene,[p/] they may also have crucial testimony.",
        "Aria: The passenger is under no obligation to testify before the court.",
        "Aria: And the current witness’s account of the events is more than adequate.",
        "Judge: I agree.",
        "Judge: I see no reason for Mr. Rudolf to disclose the identity of their client.",
        "Judge: The defense must present a more valid reason to do so.",
        "Tyrion: ...",
        "Rhys: We were driving by the McCoy Tavern when we heard a disturbance.[p/] This occurred at 1:28 am.",
        "Tyrion: I’m assuming this “disturbance” was the argument between my client and her father.",
        "Rhys: Yes.[p/] I heard two voices:[p/] one young female and one gruff male.",
        "Rhys: Presumably,[p/] these were the voices of Celeste and Flinhart McCoy.",
        "Right.[p/] That matches up with what their neighbors heard too.",
        "Aria: What did you do after hearing this disturbance, Mr. Rudolf?",
        "Rhys: Worried that something was amiss,[p/] I walked into the establishment to see what the commotion was about.",
        "Tyrion: You stopped your carriage in the [i]middle[/i] of a job?",
        "Tyrion: That seems pretty abnormal for a carriage driver.",
        "Tyrion: What did your passenger think of this?",
        "Rhys: He had no quarrel with it.",
        "Tyrion: What kind of passenger would be okay with stopping mid-drive?",
        "Aria: The passenger’s thoughts on the matter are irrelevant to his testimony.",
        "Aria: …Unless you have any hard evidence to prove otherwise.",
        "Tyrion: …",
        "Aria: Now then.[p/] Please tell us what you saw in the establishment, Mr. Rudolf.",
        "Rhys: There I saw the defendant.[p/] She was lit by the blue glow of the dining room lights.[p/][s/] She had stabbed Flinhart McCoy and was channeling magic into her sword!",
        "Tyrion: You sound certain that you saw my client and the victim.",
        "Tyrion: How were you so sure it was them?",
        "Rhys: Flinhart McCoy and his daughter were well known within the town.",
        "Rhys: Flinhart made himself quite known in the region through his…[p/] social activism.",
        "Rhys: And young Celeste dresses in a manner that is far wealthier than the townsfolk of Kornhaven.",
        "Tyrion: Do you live in the same town as the McCoys?",
        "Tyrion: How would you know about this?",
        "Rhys: I don’t live there…[p/] But my work brings me there quite frequently.",
        "Aria: The witness’s place of residence has no bearing on his testimony.",
        "Aria: What matters is that he was there when the murder occurred.",
        "…Why is Steelwind deflecting questions about his personal life?",
        "Rhys: She removed her sword from Flinhart’s back,[p/] and as he slowly turned to face her,[p/][s/] she stabbed him again in the front!",
        "Tyrion: So,[p/] you’re saying that my defendant stabbed him [i]twice[/i] with her sword?",
        "Rhys: Y-[p/]Yes…[p/] That’s [i]exactly[/i] what I saw.",
        "Tyrion: But there’s only one visible wound on the body.",
        "Tyrion: If what you say is true,[p/] then that means that she stabbed him through the same wound.",
        "Tyrion: Isn’t that extremely improbable?",
        "Aria: Improbable but not impossible.",
        "Aria: It is strange,[p/] I’ll give you that.",
        "Aria: But nevertheless,[p/] that’s what the witness [i]saw[/i] happen.",
        "She’s really reaching with this…",
        "But you won’t get anywhere unless you can [i]prove[/i] that he’s lying.",
        "Rhys: She soon realized that I had witnessed her heinous crime.[p/] She let the body fall to the ground and fled the scene.",
        "Tyrion: And you let her get away?",
        "Rhys: I’m just a simple carriage driver.",
        "Rhys: I have no way of combating an armed assailant.",
        "Aria: The witness also saw the defendant using magic.",
        "Aria: Did you honestly expect a chauffeur to subdue an armed mercenary?",
        "You suppose that she has a point there.",
        "Player: Overflow",
        "Tyrion: He must have come up with a detailed story beforehand and wrote it down.",
        "Tyrion: His little quirk of writing down everything is the perfect cover for him to read over his notes.",
        "Celeste: I guess it would be hard to catch him lying if he has a way to keep his story straight.",
        "Tyrion: Actually,[p/] it’s just the opposite.",
        "Tyrion: With all those details,[p/] it will be that much easier to find an inconsistency.",
        "You just need to find out which detail is incorrect.",

        "Player: Default",

        "Judge: I fail to see how [i]that[/i] proves anything, Mr. Cuthbert...",

        "Player: Back",
        "Tyrion Cuthbert: Mr. Rudolf.[p/] You testified that you saw my client [i]murdering[/i] the victim.",

        "Rhys Rudolf: Y-[p/][s/]Yes…[p/] I could never forget such a grisly sight.",
        "Rhys Rudolf: That moment was burned into my memory.",
        "Tyrion Cuthbert: I see…[p/] Well, it’s [i]funny[/i] that you say that.",
        "Rhys Rudolf: …How so?",
        "Tyrion Cuthbert: Because your entire testimony…",
        "Tyrion Cuthbert: ...was a complete lie!",
        "Rhys Rudolf: W-[s/]What?!",
        "Aria Steelwind: Are you accusing the witness of perjury?",
        "Aria Steelwind: Surely you know that such accusations can't be made lightly, Mr. Cuthbert.",
        "Tyrion: My accusation is far from baseless, Prosecutor Steelwind.",
        "Tyrion: Take a look at this report.",
        "Tyrion: The dining room lights are artificery devices that are powered by an arcane power cell.",
        "Tyrion: However,[p/] that same arcane power cell was broken during the time of the murder.",
        "Tyrion: The dining room lights [i]had[/i] no energy,[p/][s/] and the room would’ve been pitch black!",
        "Tyrion: The witness couldn’t have seen [i]anything[/i],[p/][s/] much less a homicide!",

        "Aria: There’s no need, witness.",
        "Aria: You could have easily seen another source of light.",
        "Aria: Perhaps one of the McCoys lit a candle because of the blackout.",
        "Tyrion: The witness clearly described a source of “blue light”!",
        "Tyrion: A candle or lantern wouldn’t emit a color like that!",
        "Aria: Then the witness was clearly mistaken!",
        "Tyrion: The witness records everything he sees in his notebook!",
        "Tyrion: He even remembers the [i]exact[/i] times that each event occurred!",
        "Tyrion: So why would he be incorrect about such a clear and [i]obvious[/i] detail?!",
        "Tyrion: No…[p/][s/] What the witness saw was clearly some form of magic!",
        "Tyrion: And due to the lack of power,[p/] it couldn’t have been artificery.[p/] It must have been an arcane spell!",
        "Rhys: …!",
        "Rhys: That’s it!",
        "Judge: What is it, witness?",
        "Rhys: I must have made an incorrect assumption!",
        "Rhys: Please allow me to revise my testimony!",
        "Judge: …",
        "Judge: What do you think of this, Prosecutor Steelwind?",
        "Aria: …If the witness wants to revise his testimony,[p/] then I see no harm in obliging him.",
        "Judge: And you, Mr. Cuthbert?",
        "Tyrion: If he thinks he saw something different,[p/] then it's only fair to hear him out.",
        "You’ll tear through each of his lies no matter [i]what[/i] he does.",
        "Rhys: I remember now![p/][s/] Yesterday,[p/] it was revealed that Flinhart was killed using magic!",
        "Rhys: I must have seen Flinhart’s daughter channeling a magic spell.",
        "Rhys: The spell was called “[b]Mage Blade[/b]”,[p/] am I correct?",
        "Rhys: That’s it![p/][s/] The blue glow that I saw must have been created by [b]Mage Blade[/b]!",
        "Judge: Hm…[p/] I see.",
        "Judge: So, the “blue light” that you saw came from the defendant’s magic.",

        "Tyrion: With pleasure.",
        "Rhys: I remember now![p/][s/] Yesterday,[p/] it was revealed that Flinhart was killed using magic!",
        "Tyrion: Are you changing your testimony based on yesterday’s trial?",
        "Rhys: No![p/][s/] I assure you![p/][s/] That’s not what I’m doing!",
        "Rhys: But after thinking about it further,[p/][s/] I think I finally [i]understand[/i] what I saw!",
        "Rhys: I must have seen Flinhart’s daughter channeling a magic spell.",
        "Tyrion: Wouldn’t that be pretty noticeable and distinct?",
        "Aria: The witness is of the commonfolk.",
        "Aria: Furthermore,[p/] the defendant’s magical ability wasn’t known to many until the night of the murder.",
        "Aria: What reason would the witness have to think that he was witnessing magic?",
        "Aria: He would just think that the sword was wreathed in a glow by some other means.",
        "That last part is a bit far-fetched…[p/] But you can’t really refute it right now.",
        "Rhys: The spell was called “[b]Mage Blade[/b]”,[p/] am I correct?",
        "Tyrion: You seem uncertain about the spell that you saw my client use.",
        "Tyrion: How can we trust the [i]rest[/i] of your testimony?",
        "Aria: The witness has no knowledge of the Arcane Arts,[p/] I'll grant you that.",
        "Aria: But it doesn’t matter if he was unable to identify the specific spell.",
        "Aria: The only thing that matters is that he [i]saw[/i] it happen.",
        "You won’t get anywhere unless you can prove that he [i]didn’t[/i] see [b]Mage Blade[/b].",
        "Rhys: That’s it![p/][s/] The blue glow that I saw must have been created by [b]Mage Blade[/b]!",
        "Tyrion: You still don’t sound so sure of it yourself.",
        "Rhys: I-[p/]I [i]wasn’t[/i] sure of it at first.",
        "Rhys: But then I remembered that Flinhart was killed using magic.",
        "Rhys: Is it really so hard to believe I didn’t realize that magic was used when I saw the scene?",

        "Tyrion: No…[p/] I admit that you probably wouldn’t know about [b]Mage Blade[/b]…",
        "Tyrion: …But that’s [i]exactly[/i] where your mistake was!",

        "Aria: This is ridiculous.",

        "Tyrion: It’s extremely significant, Prosecutor Steelwind!",
        "Tyrion: If the witness [i]did[/i] see a blue magical glow,[p/][s/] then he must have witnessed [i]another[/i] spell at the scene!",

        "Tyrion: He wrote it down in his notebook,[p/][s/] and he specifically mentioned the colour!",

        "Rhys: U-[p/]Um…[p/] W-[p/]well…",
        "Aria: Your Honor![p/][s/] The defense has no right to accuse the witness like this!",
