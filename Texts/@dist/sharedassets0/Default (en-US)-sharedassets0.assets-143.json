        "Tyrion: ……什么？",
        "Remus: 我一生犯了许多错误……",
        "Remus: 我给了维文加德自保的手段。[p/]但这一切只让他们被卷入可怕的事里。",
        "Remus: 我所创造的东西也让我苦涩……[p/]所以我把自己和自己的人民分隔开来。",
        "Remus: 我本以为最好的做法就是远离尘世，让维文加德保护自己。",
        "Remus: ……现在我明白自己有多愚蠢。",
        "Remus: 我把自己的血肉抛弃在一个不公的世界。",

        "Lucio: 不需要你的直觉。",
        "Lucio: 告诉我们之后怎么了，弗雷加。",
        "MBeatrice: 我们在花园里交谈，[p/]然后我突然感觉不适，失去了意识。",
        "Tyrion: 如果她们和你一起，[p/]妹妹们怎么没注意到？",
        "Lucio: 拉菲和米莉亚姆证言称，[p/]她们的宠物狗在走廊里乱跑。",
        "Lucio: 她们为了追狗，离开了证人和伊尔马特。",
        "Lucio: 等妹妹们再回到花园，[p/]比亚特丽丝和伊尔马特已经不见了。",
        "MBeatrice: ……",

        "MBeatrice: 我只能想象失去意识期间都被迫做了什么。",

        "MBeatrice: 我很困惑。[p/]但我之后听说了发生的事，[p/]也意识到有人操控了我的身体。",

        "MBeatrice: 是的。[p/]这是你会在祷告室看见我的唯一解释。",

        "Lucio: 奥术[i]做不到[/i]意识操控！",

        "Tyrion: 你和我的委托人确实口径一致。",
        "Tyrion: 但你看起来[i]早就知道[/i]她身上发生了什么。",
        "Tyrion: 可能你只是借此编造不在场证明。",
        "MBeatrice: 也不怪你这么想。",
        "MBeatrice: 卡斯伯特先生。[p/]我知道自己没什么信用。[p/]但我[i]现在说的[/i]都是真的。",

        "Tyrion: ……你怎么会想到这边？",
        "MBeatrice: 这个嘛，[p/]如果有证据证明是[i]别人[/i]进行操控，[p/]我[i]和[/i]阿莉亚都能脱罪。",
        "MBeatrice: 好好想想，卡斯伯特先生。[p/]难道没有",
        "MBeatrice: 这不是最佳结果吗？",
        "MBeatrice: 唉……",
        "Tyrion: ……怎么了？",
        "MBeatrice: 没事。",
        "她看起来被什么惹得不太开心……",
        "Player: Overflow",
        "她的作证方式有点奇怪。",
        "她立马得出了自己被人操控的结论。",

        "Tyrion: 但我这恰好有[i]一件[/i]证据，虽然关联相对微弱。",
        "MBeatrice: ……这件证据是？",
        "Tyrion: [i]这个[/i]符号……",
        "你把画着紫色标记的羊皮纸拿给她看。",
        "MBeatrice: ……",

        "MBeatrice: ……",
        "MBeatrice: 卡斯伯特先生，我很好奇。[p/]羊皮纸上有什么？",
        "Tyrion: 是这样，比亚特丽丝，[p/]阿莉亚之前在调查维文加德境内的一系列谋杀案。",
        "Tyrion: 这些案子手段残忍，[p/]但是[i]乍一看[/i]互不相关。",

        "Tyrion: 你和我一样是法律工作者。[p/]我们签约前都会仔细浏览内容。",
        "Tyrion: 这也引出了签约人[i]怎么[/i]获得你签名的问题。",

        "Aria: ……",
        "Tyrion: 该死……[p/]我们都不知道你签约的时候是个什么状况。",
        "Tyrion: 我们知道的只有一件事，[p/]签约人可能用了很多把戏让你中招。",

        "不管他的动力是[i]什么[/i]，[p/]你都会战胜他。[p/]就像战胜别人那样。",
        "Tyrion: 该回去了，塞莱斯特。",
        "Celeste: 好……",
        "不管要做什么，[p/]你都会坚持到最后。",
        "Rath: 现在审理继续。[p/]就从中断的地方开始吧？",
        "Rath: 你接下来要怎么做？",
        "Tyrion: 我们应该回顾一下关于谋杀案[i]已知[/i]的事情。",
        "Lucio: 哼……[p/]我们确实还有很多目击证人。",
        "Tyrion: 没错……[p/]从最开头说起吧。",
        "Tyrion: 一切都始于昨天中午。",
        "Tyrion: 我，阿莉亚，我的护卫塞莱斯特三人都在我位于瑞思霍姆的家里。",
        "Tyrion: 我们在谈关于一封突然被寄来的信的事情。",
        "Tyrion: 寄信人是加里克·皮尔斯。[p/]他希望下午2:00，与我和塞莱斯特在鳞甲领主大教堂见面。",
        "Tyrion: 为了确保准时，[p/]我们下午 1:00 就抵达了大教堂。",
        "Tyrion: 当时我们还不知道，[p/]大教堂已经不对公众开放了。",
        "Tyrion: 但看守大教堂的骑士放我们进去了。",
        "Tyrion: 他们似乎早知道我们会来。",
        "Lucio: ……这[i]不[/i]应该。",
        "Lucio: 出于事态严肃性，[p/]只有个别人被允许进入大教堂。",
        "Tyrion: 可能有人背后牵线让我们进去。",
        "Lucio: ……[i]也可能[/i]是你们俩违法进了大教堂。",
        "Tyrion: 这个嘛，问问国王卫队的骑士不就知道了。",
        "Lucio: 国王卫队的[i]每条[/i]命令我都知晓。",
        "Lucio: [i]没有[/i]哪条说了要放你们通过。",
        "Tyrion: ……我们遇见的骑士可能也是昏迷者之一。",
        "Tyrion: 在他们恢复意识之前，[p/]我们无从得知。",
        "Rath: 我们先继续进行吧……",
        "Lucio: 哼……",
        "Tyrion: 总之，[p/]我们提前抵达教堂，[p/]去见皮尔斯之前的一小时里简单赏景。",
        "Tyrion: 这段时间里，[p/]我们遇见了雷穆斯，[p/]卢西奥，[p/]阿莉亚，[p/]阿斯特，[p/]阿拉里克。",
        "Tyrion: 同一时间，[p/]阿莉亚和阿斯特一起去议长舍与之会面。",
        "Tyrion: 探索大教堂时，[p/]我们还与冯·桑克图斯和希比尔交谈过。",
        "Tyrion: 之后还与弗雷加三姐妹及厄莉斯·伊尔马特交谈。",
        "Lucio: 厄莉斯·伊尔马特？",
        "Tyrion: 她是比亚特丽丝·弗雷加的一个朋友。",
        "Tyrion: 国王卫队不允许她把自己的使魔带进大教堂。",
        "Tyrion: 厄莉斯就充当了她的向导。",
        "Lucio: 嗯……",
        "Tyrion: 总之，[p/]我们下午1:45左右离开花园去祷告室见皮尔斯。",
        "Tyrion: 与此同时，[p/]阿莉亚因感到恶心而离开了与议长的谈话。",
        "Tyrion: 她最后记得的场面是自己看向迦拉克隆湖。",
        "Lucio: 真是个好[i]故事[/i]。",
        "Tyrion: [i]不管怎样[/i]，[p/]下午 2:00，[p/]阿斯特去悼念先王。",
        "Tyrion: 但他并不知道，遗棺那里被法师设下了[b]有备无患[/b]法术。",
        "Tyrion: 目的是为了用[b]坚牢术[/b]困住他。",
        "Rath: 真是卑鄙……",
        "Lucio: 考虑到之后发生的事情，[p/]攻击国王陛下可能是为了声东击西……",
        "Tyrion: 没错……",
        "Tyrion: 这也是比亚特丽丝和厄莉斯失踪的时间。",
        "Tyrion: 考虑到这些事情的发生时间，[p/]比亚特丽丝被操控是在阿斯特被困[i]之后[/i]。",
        "Lucio: ……你要说控制了[i]她[/i]的也是“签约人”？",
        "Tyrion: 不。[p/]我不觉得……",
        "Tyrion: 根据契约内容，[p/]她的意识归属无序女皇，[p/]并不是签约人。",
        "Tyrion: 此外，[p/]也是女皇[i]起草[/i]阿莉亚的血契。",
        "Tyrion: 签约人和女皇显然是同谋关系。",
        "Lucio: ……很好。[p/][i]又多一个[/i]恶魔。",
        "Tyrion: ……先不提这个，[p/]签约人和女皇准备就绪。",
        "Tyrion: 屠杀也在此刻开始。",
        "Tyrion: 签约人控制了阿莉亚的身体。[p/]利用她在下午 2:05 杀害了冯·桑克图斯。",
        "Tyrion: 根据推测，[p/]阿莉亚此时在公共休息室纵火。",
        "Tyrion: 这里也是冯·桑克图斯尸体的发现场所，[p/]意味着这里就是谋杀现场。",
        "Tyrion: 之后不久，[p/]阿拉里克王子看到冒出的烟，问阿莉亚怎么回事。",
        "Tyrion: 阿莉亚用未知的[b]形变[/b]法术使其无法行动。",
        "Lucio: 这个签约人竟敢利用她攻击王子……",
        "Tyrion: 幸运的是，[p/]法术效果只是暂时的，[p/]阿拉里克没有受伤。",
        "Tyrion: 这之后，[p/]下午 2:15，签约人控制阿莉亚杀害希比尔。",
        "Tyrion: 希比尔的尸体被带到西侧阳台，[p/]阿莉亚在这里将尸体投入迦拉克隆湖中。",
        "Tyrion: 议长阿契厄斯目击了这一行为。[p/]但他后来才意识到被从阳台丢下的是什么。",
        "Tyrion: 议长虽然觉得奇怪。[p/]但他还是继续去忙自己的事了。",
        "Tyrion: 他的目的地是祷告室。[p/]但被那里的守卫拒之门外。",
        "Tyrion: 与此同时，[p/]塞莱斯特和我……[p/]正与皮尔斯勋爵[i]交谈[/i]。",
        "Tyrion: 我们提早出现在了约定地点，[p/]但当时他等的明显是别人。",
        "Tyrion: 我们试图探究怎么回事。[p/]但他拒绝回答问题。",
        "Tyrion: 下午 2:20 左右，我们听到外面有骚乱。",
        "Tyrion: 塞莱斯特出去调查了。",
        "Tyrion: ……也就是在这时和阿莉亚博斗起来。",
        "Tyrion: 签约人的目标是加里克·皮尔斯，[p/]但塞莱斯特强得他束手无策。",
        "Tyrion: 双方斗了大约15分钟，阿莉亚才终于成功推开她。",
        "Lucio: ……",
        "Tyrion: 二人搏斗期间，[p/]女皇派比亚特丽丝进入祷告室。",
        "Tyrion: 可能也用了隐形法术避人耳目。",
        "Tyrion: 之后女皇利用她施展[b]睡眠术[/b]，让我和皮尔斯失去意识。",
        "Tyrion: 当时我记得自己特意看了一下时间。",
        "Tyrion: 一定是下午 2:30 没错。",
        "Lucio: ……假设你的证言属实，[p/]比亚特丽丝·弗雷加也是计划里的重要一环。",
        "Tyrion: 对……[p/]考虑到屠杀的迅速程度，[p/]女皇和签约人一定在合作。",
        "Tyrion: 两人应该提前商议好了，怎么利用比亚特丽丝和阿莉亚实施谋杀。",
        "Tyrion: 总之[p/]，比亚特丽丝让我们沉睡之后，[p/]阿莉亚才终于推开塞莱斯特进入祷告室。",
        "Tyrion: 在塞莱斯特追上她之前，[p/]阿莉亚就已经杀掉皮尔斯。",
        "Tyrion: 塞莱斯特进入房间时，阿莉雅和我已经失去意识。",
        "Tyrion: 签约人杀害了三名贵族，实现了目标。",
        "Tyrion: 他们也不再需要操控阿莉亚，这可能是她失去意识的原因。",
        "Tyrion: 阿莉亚和我很快恢复了意识。",
        "Tyrion: 此时裁判所以谋杀罪名逮捕了她。",
        "Lucio: 唔……[p/]皮尔斯勋爵是受害者之一。",
        "Lucio: 你们的会面比我预想的要重要。",
        "Lucio: 所以卡斯伯特，告诉我。[p/][s/]你们谈论的内容是？",
        "Tyrion: ……",
        "Celeste: ……没关系。[p/]可以告诉他们。",
        "Tyrion: 好吧……[p/]只要你不介意。",
        "Tyrion: ……过去数个月，[p/]塞莱斯特和我都在调查谁是她的亲生父母。",
        "Lucio: 哼……[p/]我记得有不少人抱怨她在勋爵舞会期间的行为。",
        "Tyrion: 理论上，[p/]加里克·皮尔斯握有我们寻找的答案。",
        "Tyrion: 寄给我们的信里说，他想“用这一信息交换自己的自由”。",
        "Tyrion: 我[i]以为[/i]这是他让我当自己的律师。",
        "Lucio: 你觉得我们会信？！",
        "Lucio: 为什么他要找给自己定罪的律师辩护？！",
        "Tyrion: [i]我们[/i]也这么想过。",
        "Tyrion: 到达会面地点时，[p/]皮尔斯找的人明显不是[i]我[/i]。",
        "Tyrion: 收到这封信的本应另有其人。",
        "Rath: ……",
        "Lucio: ……最好别让我发现你在说谎，卡斯伯特。",
        "Tyrion: 不绕弯子，[p/]我不在乎你信不信。",
        "Tyrion: 不提这个，[p/]仔细回顾阿莉亚的行为，[p/]我们可以完善签约人的心理档案。",
        "Lucio: ……这一点确实。",
        "Tyrion: 首先，[p/]辩方希望传唤裁判所指挥官作证。",
        "Tyrion: 他的证言或许能解释冯·桑克图斯与希比尔的死亡之谜。",
        "Tyrion: 尽管目击证词众多，[p/]我们明确知道的也只有[i]皮尔斯[/i]的死法。",
        "Lucio: 对……[p/]他被用自己的血冻成的魔法剑刃刺穿心脏。",
        "这么说有点残酷，[p/]但他和弗林哈特死法一致也是受报应。",
        "虽然这么说也不会让塞莱斯特更好受。",
        "Tyrion: 不管怎样，[p/]我们需要找出杀害这两人的[i]具体[/i]手段。",
        "Tyrion: 屠杀高效迅速。",
        "Tyrion: 事前规划与临场合作必不可少。",
        "Tyrion: 如果能知道谁可能拥有足够情报，[p/]或许就能揪出幕后黑手。",
        "Rath: 我明白了……[p/]听起来是个很好的计划。",
        "Lucio: 国王卫队！[p/][s/]护送指挥官奥蒙·怀特上证人席！",
        "Lucio: 证人。[p/]请向法庭陈述你的姓名与职业。",
        "Orym: 呃、[p/][s/]好……[p/][s/]我……[p/][s/]唔……",
        "Orym: ……",
        "Tyrion: 指挥官？",
        "Orym: 对不起！[p/][s/]我做不到啊！",
        "Orym: 我怎么能若无其事？！",
        "Orym: 我[i]正后方[/i]可站着一只大蜥蜴！",
        "Rath: ……说我是蜥蜴可[i]非常[/i]粗鲁，指挥官。",
        "Orym: 对、[p/][s/]对不起，鳞甲领主……[p/]殿下……",
        "Tyrion: 指挥官……[p/]努力证言发生了什么就好。",
        "Orym: 好、[p/][s/]好的……",
        "Orym: 一切都要从我们收到国王卫队报告时说起。[p/]检察官攻击了阿拉里克王子，公共休息室还着火了。",
        "Orym: 我们不确定斯蒂尔文德那边怎么回事。[p/]就先去公共休息室帮忙灭火。",
        "Orym: 但我们抵达时，[p/]发现一群卫兵昏倒在祷告室前。",
        "Orym: 我们就先去了祷告室。[p/]也在那里发现了皮尔斯的尸体，以及旁边失去意识的斯蒂尔文德和卡斯伯特。",
        "Orym: 之后我们也发现了冯·桑克图斯和希比尔的尸体。[p/]这时我们才意识到三个人都是被她杀害的。",
        "Tyrion: 所以你们还是不知道被操控的斯蒂尔文德怎么杀掉冯·桑克图斯与希比尔的？",
        "Orym: 毫无头绪。",
        "Orym: 冯·桑克图斯的情况更糟。[p/]火几乎烧掉了所有尸体上的线索。",
        "Tyrion: 那希比尔呢？[p/]她身上有没有留下线索？",
        "Orym: 我也不清楚。[p/]她没有遭受外伤。",
        "Orym: 我们只知道她是窒息身亡。",
        "嗯……[p/]调查中肯定还有其他信息。",
        "Orym: 一切都要从我们收到国王卫队报告时说起。[p/]检察官攻击了阿拉里克王子，公共休息室还着火了。",
        "Tyrion: 报告主要基于阿拉里克王子的证言。[p/]没错吧？",
        "Orym: 没错。[p/]我们还是不知道她用的是什么[b]形变[/b]法术。",
        "Tyrion: 根据报告时间来看，[p/]肯定是在三起谋杀过去一段时间以后。",
        "Orym: 对。[p/]这样的结果令人遗憾。",
        "Orym: 如果斯蒂尔文德真的[i]被操控[/i]了，[p/]也是被效率很高的人操控。",
        "问题就是为什么幕后黑手这么高效。",
        "Orym: 我们不确定斯蒂尔文德那边怎么回事。[p/]就先去公共休息室帮忙灭火。",
        "Tyrion: 这么做明智吗？",
        "Tyrion: 不管犯人是谁，[p/]被攻击的可是维文加德王子。",
        "Orym: 被[b]坚牢术[/b]困住的国王已经够让人忙活了。",
        "Orym: 那一小时里发生了[i]太多[/i]。",
        "Orym: 我们的注意力都放在保护皇室安全上。",
        "Lucio: 现在已经能确定攻击国王是为了转移注意。",
        "Lucio: 策划这些的人知道，我们会集中力量保证皇室安全。",
        "这也有道理。[p/]伤亡人数里也包括不少国王卫队的骑士。",

        "Tyrion: 你有看见阿莉亚或者塞莱斯特吗？",
        "Orym: 没有……[p/]只看见了她们搏斗后的一片狼藉。",
        "Orym: 走廊里到处都是印痕和凹坑。",
        "Lucio: 皮尔斯的死亡时间是下午2:45。",
        "Lucio: 骑士们直到下午3:10才抵达公共休息室。",
        "Lucio: 搏斗发生过去一阵后他们才到达祷告室。",
        "Tyrion: 等等……[p/]你和皮尔斯的尸体在一起待了25分钟？",
        "Tyrion: 为什么不找人帮忙？",
        "Celeste: 因、[p/][s/]因为你醒不过来。[p/]所以我一直在给你传输治愈魔力。",
        "Celeste: 现在想想，[p/]我确实应该找人帮忙。",

        "Tyrion: 呃、[p/][s/]是啊……[p/]抱歉……",
        "回忆当时的事让她很难受。",
        "最好小心一点。",

        "Orym: 对。[p/]我们当时一头雾水。",
        "Orym: 皮尔斯已经死了。[p/]你和斯蒂尔文德也没有意识。",
        "Tyrion: 我知道[i]自己[/i]为什么没有意识。[p/]我当时被用了专门催眠别人的法术。",
        "Tyrion: 但阿莉亚怎么也失去了意识？",
        "Orym: 我们也不懂。[p/]恶魔操控的事情我们都是今天才[i]听说[/i]。",
        "Orym: 就我们掌握的情报而言，[p/]那可能是被操控意识一小时以上的后遗症。",
        "这么说有道理。[p/]但这个方向的逻辑真的只是巧合吗？",
        "Orym: 之后我们也发现了冯·桑克图斯和希比尔的尸体。[p/]这时我们才意识到三个人都是被她杀害的。",
        "嗯……[p/]最后一句证词有点含糊。",
        "也许应该让他针对其中一件谋杀案展开说明。",
        "Orym: 斯蒂尔文德肯定是在公共休息室攻击了冯·桑克图斯，使其窒息。",

        "Orym: 攻击肯定使他痛苦异常。",

        "Orym: 斯蒂尔文德肯定是在阳台附近攻击了希比尔。[p/]根据尸检报告，[p/]她用某种手段令其窒息。",
        "Tyrion: 因为有人在尸体上用了[b]疗愈术[/b]，[p/]窒息手段不得而知。",
        "Orym: 对……[p/]想搞清楚很麻烦。",

        "Tyrion: 你们怎么知道尸体在那里？",
        "Orym: 屠杀开始后，[p/]我们发现哪儿都找不到她。",
        "Orym: 国王卫队成员之一使用了[b]定位生物[/b]，发现她的位置在湖里。",

        "Tyrion: 这些谋杀案里，[p/]皮尔斯的案子情报最多。",
        "Orym: 对。[p/]目前来看，[p/]签约人也没打算放过麦考伊。",
        "Orym: 那场持久战想必打了他们一个措手不及。",
        "Lucio: 我觉得[i]这[/i]有点奇怪……",
        "Tyrion: ……为什么？",
        "Lucio: 我的女儿可当不了士兵。[p/]她一点战斗天赋都没有。",
        "Lucio: 而且我[i]本人[/i]体验过麦考伊的战斗能力。",
        "Lucio: 虽然不愿意承认，[p/]但公平战斗的话，麦考伊应该能轻松碾压我的女儿。",
        "Celeste: 她、[p/]她的魔法很难缠。",
        "Celeste: 我也完全不知道她能用什么法术。[p/]所以必须小心应战。",
        "Celeste: ……虽然发生了这么多，[p/]但我当时[i]真的[/i]不想伤害她。",
        "Lucio: 唔……[p/]太过善良会害死你的，麦考伊。",

        "Orym: 去除了尸体上的所有外伤。",
        "Tyrion: ……和凯瑟琳·贝尔维瑟一模一样。",

        "Theon: 当然不对！[p/][s/]我的血怎么够呢！",
        "Lucio: 你让我说完——？！",
        "Theon: 主啊，我任您处置！",
        "Theon: 要花点时间就是了。",
        "Theon: 召集追求者也需要时间——",
        "Rath: 老天爷啊！[p/][s/]我们只想要你的证言！",
        "Rath: ……只需要你告诉我们，昨天在西侧阳台看见斯蒂尔文德女士干了什么。",
        "Theon: ……噢、[p/][s/]噢，我明白了。",
        "Theon: 主啊，如果这真的是您的愿望。",
        "Tyrion: ……我们就[i]不管[/i]他刚才的大屠杀宣言了？",
        "Lucio: 住嘴！[p/][s/]不要再挑动他了！",
        "Theon: 我在住所进行文书工作，忙到忘了时间。[p/]听到闹钟才想起来，该进行下午的祷告了。",
        "Theon: 我向着祷告室出发，发现斯蒂尔文德女士正在西侧阳台往下看。",
        "Theon: 我向她打招呼，但被无视了。[p/]这时我发现，她正从阳台把什么大东西推入迦拉克隆湖。",
        "Theon: 我问她在干什么。[p/]但她还是无视了我，[p/]转身向祷告室走去。",
        "Theon: 我没多想，也向祷告室走过去。[p/]看守的卫兵把我拦下了。",
        "Theon: 我就折返回自己的房间祈祷。",
        "Tyrion: 从时间上看，[p/]这些事就发生在她开始攻击祷告室几分钟前。",
        "Theon: 是的……[p/]我很幸运。[p/]仁慈的鳞甲领主保佑了我。",
        "Rath: 拜托。[p/] 不要……[p/] 说了。",
        "考虑到她的移动迅速程度，[p/]等这几分钟一定有其理由。",
        "她在等议长离开吗？",
        "也许应该更仔细检查一下每件事发生的时间点。",
        "Theon: 我在住所进行文书工作，忙到忘了时间。[p/]听到闹钟才想起来，该进行下午的祷告了。",
        "Tyrion: 闹钟？",
        "Theon: 是一个很简单的奥术能源装置。[p/]我借此提醒自己每日祷告。",
        "Tyrion: ……明白了。[p/]需要你本人设置闹钟时间吗？",
        "Theon: 需要。[p/]我设定的时间是下午 2:10：祷告五分钟前。",
        "Theon: 下午 2:10 闹钟响的时候，我在房间里。[p/]听见铃声才意识到该进行下午的祷告了。",
        "Tyrion: 所以你下午一般在 2:15 祷告？",
        "Theon: 是的。[p/]这也是巨龙之神巴哈姆特的神圣时刻。",
        "Rath: ……[i]我[/i]倒是头一次听说。",
        "Theon: 我犯错了？！",
        "Theon: 主啊，请原谅我！[p/]我竟然亵渎了神灵！",
        "Rath: 呜呃……[p/]算了算了。",
        "Rath: 忘掉刚才的话吧……",
        "Theon: 我向着祷告室出发，发现斯蒂尔文德女士正在西侧阳台往下看。",
        "Tyrion: 她是什么表情？",
        "Theon: 冰冷且没有感情。",
        "Lucio: ……当时她肯定还在被签约人操控。",
        "Theon: 确实。[p/]这样解释最合理。",
        "Tyrion: 确实……[p/]",
        "Tyrion: 具体时间是？",
        "Theon: 我的闹钟响完不久。[p/]肯定是在下午 2:15 之前。",
        "Theon: 我向着祷告室出发，发现斯蒂尔文德女士正在西侧阳台往下看。[p/]时间是下午 2:15 之前。",
        "Tyrion: 所以她在看迦拉克隆湖？",
        "Theon: 现在想来，[p/]她可能在检查能不能从这里把希比尔小姐的尸体丢[i]入[/i]湖里。",
        "Tyrion: 但她好像不介意[i]你[/i]在旁边看着啊。",
        "Tyrion: 说到底，为什么她要大费周章藏尸呢？",
        "Lucio: 签约人明显是为了推迟谋杀案被发现的时间。",
        "Lucio: 毕竟被告很晚才成功杀害了皮尔斯。",
        "的确说得通。[p/]但他们应该没有[i]预料[/i]到要和塞莱斯特打那么久。",
        "她把希比尔的尸体丢入湖里[i]一定[/i]是有理由的。",
        "Theon: 我向她打招呼，但被无视了。[p/]这时我发现，她正从阳台把什么大东西推入迦拉克隆湖。",
        "Tyrion: 你被无视了？她是什么表情？",
        "Theon: 冰冷且没有感情。",
        "Lucio: ……当时她肯定还在被签约人操控。",
        "Theon: 确实。[p/]这样解释最合理。",
        "Tyrion: 你什么时间遇见她的？",
        "Theon: 我的闹钟响完不久。[p/]肯定是在下午 2:15 之前。",
        "Theon: 当时还没到下午 2:15。[p/]我们只短暂相遇。[p/]这时我发现，她正从阳台把什么大东西推入迦拉克隆湖。",
        "Tyrion: ……一定是希比尔的尸体。",
        "Theon: ……应该是的。",
        "Tyrion: ……听起来没什么自信啊。",
        "Theon: 我印象里希比尔小姐的衣袍颜色更为鲜艳。",
        "Theon: 可是，[p/]斯蒂尔文德女士扔进湖里的东西颜色暗沉。",
        "Tyrion: 对了……[p/]你之前也提到过。",
        "Lucio: 肯定只是阳光的影响。",
        "Lucio: 阳台就在希比尔小姐尸体的发现位置正上方。",
        "Lucio: [i]很明显[/i]，你看到的是被告在丢弃尸体。",
        "Lucio: 不然还能是什么？",
        "Theon: 嗯……[p/]你说的大概没错。",
        "Theon: 我问她在干什么。[p/]但她还是无视了我，[p/]转身向祷告室走去。",
        "Tyrion: 签约人可能在操控她赶时间。",
        "Tyrion: 但您没被攻击还是让我很惊讶。",
        "Tyrion: 就算假设签约人要栽赃，[p/]当时她也还没杀掉皮尔斯。",
        "Theon: 是的。[p/]这一点我也不明白。",
        "Theon: 可能我该庆幸自己毫发无损。",
        "Tyrion: 总之，[p/]你们相遇多久？",
        "Theon: 因为她根本没理我，所以时间不长。",
        "Theon: 感觉不超过两分钟。",
        "Theon: 我花了大约两分钟尝试和她交谈。[p/]但她还是无视了我，[p/]转身向祷告室走去。",
        "Tyrion: 看来你们只是擦肩而过啊。",
        "Lucio: 签约人当时正在控制她。",
        "Lucio: 肯定是觉得无视的话议长就会更快离开。",
        "但是就地把他杀了不也很容易？",
        "杀了议长然后把他也扔进湖里应该不难。[p/]就像对希比尔做的那样。",
        "Theon: 我没多想，也向祷告室走过去。[p/]看守的卫兵把我拦下了。",
        "Tyrion: 是说……[p/]这些看守还在昏迷中。",
        "[i]依然[/i]找不到合理解释让你很不自在。",
        "无序女皇用了什么恶魔才会的魔法吗？",

        "但现在也只能暂时记在心里。",
        "Tyrion: 总之，[p/]这是什么时候发生的？",
        "Theon: 应该是下午 2:15。[p/]我通常也是这个时间抵达祷告室。",
        "Theon: 我没多想，也向祷告室走过去。[p/]下午 2:15 到达时，看守的卫兵把我拦下了。",

        "Tyrion: 屠杀期间你一直呆在房间里？",
        "Theon: 是的。[p/]之前也提到过，[p/]我的房间利用魔法做了隔音。",
        "Theon: 房间看守和我都完全没意识到在发生什么。",
        "Theon: 直到国王卫队成员来通知我，我们才知道国王身上发生了什么。",
        "国王卫队的成员和他自己的“看守”当时都在场。",
        "那些人应该也能证实议长没有撒谎。[p/]虽然他这逃过一劫还是太巧合了。",
        "Tyrion: 总之，[p/]你在房间里待了多久。",
        "Theon: 一直待到国王卫队说已经安全了。",
        "Theon: 我想应该是直到下午 3:15。",
        "就是阿莉亚被捕的时间。",
        "Theon: 我就折返回自己的房间祈祷。[p/]在那里一直等到下午 3:15。",
        "Tyrion: 所以屠杀结束前你都在自己的房间里。",
        "Tyrion: 这期间你的看守有看到斯蒂尔文德吗？",
        "Theon: 他们没有。",
        "Theon: 我们只知道国王陛下被困住了。",
        "Theon: 我们并不知道斯蒂尔文德女士当时在攻击别人。",
        "Lucio: 议长明显不是签约人的目标之一。",
        "Lucio: 签约人完全没有想让我的女儿和议长对上。",

        "Tyrion: 但也留下了一个问题……",
        "Lucio: ……",
        "Lucio: ……不要欲言又止了。[p/]我不[i]蠢[/i]，卡斯伯特。",
        "Tyrion: 其实，[p/]我并不觉得是你。",
        "Lucio: ……来这套？",
        "Tyrion: 在场所有人里，[p/]你确实能轻易骗自己的女儿签约血契。",
        "Tyrion: 但你[i]有什么[/i]必要这么做？",
        "Tyrion: 你是维文加德的大将军，[p/]教堂里[i]遍布[/i]你的手下。",
        "Tyrion: 你完全可以用下属法师来杀人。",
        "Tyrion: 也不[i]需要[/i]和恶魔签什么契约。",
        "Rath: 那卢西奥为什么[i]没有[/i]被刺杀？",
        "Tyrion: 根据与塞莱斯特的搏斗来看，[p/]阿莉亚的战斗能力有限。",
        "Tyrion: 签约人可能只是觉得阿莉亚打不过大将军。",
        "Tyrion: 但还有另一种解释。",
        "Player: 签约人 想要栽赃 斯蒂尔文德一家 谋杀罪名",
        "Player: Fail",
        "不对……[p/]签约人没有攻击过卢西奥·斯蒂尔文德。",
        "控制阿莉亚的时候，[p/]签约人也没有想着隐藏她的行踪。",
        "他们[i]想让[/i]别人看见她。",
        "Tyrion:签约人[i]想让[/i]别人怀疑斯蒂尔文德家犯案。",
        "Tyrion: 因此利用卢西奥·斯蒂尔文德的女儿杀人。",
        "Tyrion: 所以他们刻意留了活口，让人们怀疑斯蒂尔文德勋爵。",
        "Lucio: 他们利用我女儿就是[i]这个[/i]原因？",
        "……你感到的是一丝愤怒吗？",
        "Tyrion: ……总之，[p/][i]这个[/i]原因和我之后要说的有关。",
        "Tyrion: 假设我们从未发现阿莉亚与无序女皇签订的血契。",
        "Tyrion: 会发生什么？",
        "Rath: ……我们会认为斯蒂尔文德女士感染了法师之疫。",
        "Rath: 她会被判谋杀罪成立，[p/]斯蒂尔文德家也会立刻失势。",
        "Tyrion: 一个月前左右，[p/]弗雷加一族的领主去世。",
        "Tyrion: 继任者：[p/]拉菲·弗雷加[p/]仓促上阵，毫无准备。",
        "Tyrion: [i]现在[/i]，冯·桑克图斯和希比尔家的领主也都死了。",
        "Tyrion: ……而斯蒂尔文德家的人要承担这一切罪名。",
        "Rath: 四大支柱家族都会因屠杀被削弱……",
        "Tyrion: 我认为还有一层意义。",
        "Tyrion: 假设签约人的目的是削弱四大支柱家族，一切都说得通了。",
        "Tyrion: ……加里克·皮尔斯谋杀案[i]除外[/i]。",
        "Lucio: 是的……[p/]与希比尔和冯·桑克图斯不同，[p/]皮尔斯没什么政治影响力。",
        "Tyrion: 更重要的是，[p/]皮尔斯下个月就要因谋杀弗林哈特·麦考伊被执行死刑。",
        "Tyrion: 为什么签约人要杀一个将死之人？",
        "Player: 皮尔斯 知道了 塞莱斯特父母 身份",
        "Player: Fail",
        "不对……[p/]不管签约人做什么，皮尔斯都[i]会[/i]死。",
        "皮尔斯最近肯定做过什么事。",
        "直接导致签约人必须尽快杀害他。",
        "Tyrion: 签约人需要皮尔斯尽快死亡，所以才杀害了他。",
        "Tyrion: 皮尔斯[i]知道[/i]塞莱斯特亲生父母的身份。",
        "Celeste: ……我的父母？",
        "Tyrion: 你记得皮尔斯会面当天说了什么吧？",
        "Garrick: 啊……[p/]你终于到了……",
        "Garrick: 看来你已经下了决心——",
        "Garrick: 等等……[p/][s/]你们两个？",
        "Celeste: 我们收到了你的信。",
        "Garrick: 信？[p/][s/]什么信？！",
        "Tyrion: 你……[p/]寄的信。皮尔斯。",
        "Tyrion: 信里说你知道塞莱斯特的父母是谁。",
        "Garrick: 我[i]确实[/i]寄了信，[p/]但不是给[i]你们[/i]。",
        "Tyrion: 信该寄给的人不是我们。",
        "Celeste: ……对了！",
        "Tyrion: 也就有一个问题。",
        "Player: 签约人",
        "Player: Fail",
        "不对……[p/]皮尔斯应该是把信寄给了和案件密切相关的人。",
        "只有一个可能性。",
        "Tyrion: 只有一个可能收到信的人。",
        "Tyrion: 就是策划屠杀的签约人！",
        "Lucio: 你是说——！",
        "Tyrion: 塞莱斯特父母的身份会对签约人不利！",
        "Rath: 肃静！注意法庭秩序！",
        "Celeste: 但是……[p/]我不懂。",
        "Tyrion: 抱歉。[p/]我知道这很难接受。",
        "Tyrion: 但签约人肯定是在针对你。",
        "Tyrion: 皮尔斯知道塞莱斯特亲生父母的身份，尝试借此威胁签约人。",
        "Tyrion: 但签约人没有遵从皮尔斯的要求，[p/]转手把信寄给了我。",
        "Lucio: 为什么要费力气诱使[i]你[/i]过去？！",
        "Lucio: 签约人大可以让皮尔斯在祷告室内等候，同时控制被告实施杀人。",
        "Tyrion: 回想一下，[p/]签约人很可能也想杀掉塞莱斯特。",
        "Celeste: ……什么？",
        "Tyrion: 签约人知道我不会单独和皮尔斯见面。[p/]也知道关于[i]塞莱斯特[/i]的信息。",
        "Tyrion: 签约人应该猜到我会和她一同前往。",
        "Tyrion: 同时杀掉皮尔斯和塞莱斯特能清除任何后者可能带来的风险，[p/]一举两得。",
        "Celeste: ……",
        "Rath: ……谁会被这种事情威胁到？",
        "Lucio: 麦考伊的[i]存在[/i]就会威胁到他们……",
        "Lucio: 肯定和她的[i]继承权[/i]有关系。",
        "Tyrion: 没错……",
        "Tyrion: 也就意味着是？",
        "皇室",
        "Tyrion: ……维文加德国王最近去世了。",
        "Tyrion: 如果塞莱斯特是皇室成员呢？",
        "Celeste: ……你觉得我是公主？！",
        "Tyrion: 我不想怀疑阿斯特。[p/]但我们[i]必须[/i]考虑所有可能性。",
        "Tyrion: 如果涉及到继承权，[p/]最有可能的就是皇权。",
        "Tyrion: 不仅如此，[p/]国王也有权赦免皮尔斯的罪。",
        "Lucio: 但这不完全说得通。",
        "Tyrion: 什么意思？",
        "Lucio: 如果麦考伊被丢弃在科尔哈文的小酒馆里，[p/]会被视为私生子。",
        "Celeste: 好吧……[p/]嘴上不饶人。",
        "Lucio: ……[i]重点[/i]是奥利维尔王不会为了皇权丢弃婴儿。",
        "Lucio: 王国需要皇权继承人来延续血脉。",
        "Lucio: 他会利用这个女儿进行政治联姻。",
        "Tyrion: ……令人作呕。",
        "Lucio: 外交手段，卡斯伯特。",
        "Lucio: 总之，[p/]即使麦考伊确实有皇家血统，[p/]阿斯特也是长子。",
        "Lucio: 而且还是纯血长子。",
        "Lucio: 麦考伊甚至都摸不着王座的边。",
        "Tyrion: 这样……[p/]我懂你的意思。",
        "Tyrion: 看来要先排除阿斯特了。",
        "弗雷加一族",
        "Tyrion: 我记得比亚特丽丝·弗雷加受审时，[p/]威廉的遗嘱也被公布了。",
        "Tyrion: 其中提到弗雷加一族的家产会平均分给他的[i]所有[/i]孩子。",
        "Lucio: 喔……[p/]如果麦考伊其实是弗雷加的人，[p/]他的女儿们就必须和她平分财产。",
        "Celeste: ……我真是弗雷加的人？",
        "Tyrion: 我不想怀疑拉菲或者米莉亚姆。[p/]但我们[i]必须[/i]考虑所有可能性。",
        "Tyrion: 我们也知道，[p/]弗雷加一族有和恶魔签约的前科。",
        "Tyrion: 但是，[p/]还是说不通。[p/]我不觉得拉菲或者米莉亚姆能做出这种事。",
        "Rath: ……你的论据是？",
        "Tyrion: 我很擅长判断人品。[p/]她们俩做不出这种事。",
        "Lucio: 呸！[p/]你真让人失望。",
        "Lucio: 威廉的[i]每个[/i]孩子都干得出这种事。",
        "Tyrion: ……那我们等着看吧。",
        "斯蒂尔文德一家",
        "Tyrion: ……虽然难以置信，[p/]但斯蒂尔文德是支柱家族里唯一没有失去领主的。",
        "Lucio: ……你觉得[i]我[/i]是麦考伊的生父？",
        "Celeste: 呜哇……[p/]你对自己[i]已知[/i]的亲生女儿都不怎么样。",
        "Tyrion: 我只是在陈述一种可能性。",
        "Tyrion: 之前也说过，[p/]明知[i]斯蒂尔文德家[/i]会被怀疑的你不可能去陷害自己的女儿。",
        "Tyrion: 但我们要考虑所有可能性。",
        "夺眼者",
        "Tyrion: ……如果是夺眼者策划了这些呢？",
        "Lucio: 夺眼者？[p/]那个黑道？",
        "Lucio: [i]他[/i]策划这些干什么？",
        "Tyrion: 我亲耳听他说计划扩大自己在维文加德的影响力。",
        "Tyrion: 他也和比亚特丽丝同谋试图利用弗雷加一族。",
        "Tyrion: 由于我破坏了他的计划，[p/]他只能采用屠杀这个替补。",
        "Tyrion: 也许我们的看法都是错的。",
        "Tyrion: 或许塞莱斯特其实是皇室成员，他们计划利用她夺取王座？",
        "Lucio: 如果他想这么做，[p/]为什么还要让我的女儿攻击麦考伊？",
        "Lucio: 不仅如此。[p/]他还有机会谋杀国王。",
        "Lucio: 只需要在[b]有备无患[/b]里设下更为致命的法术。",
        "Lucio: 国王陛下可能就和冯·桑克图斯，希比尔，皮尔斯一起归西了。",
        "Tyrion: 确实……[p/]你说得没错。",
        "Tyrion: 但我们要考虑所有可能性。",
        "Tyrion: 总之，[p/]先考虑一下其他选项吧。",
        "Tyrion: 唔……[p/]我想不出别人了。",
        "Lucio: 对。[p/]每个可能项都有漏洞。",
        "Lucio: 你的逻辑就有问题。",
        "那[i]你[/i]倒是说个没有问题的……",
        "Tyrion: ……",
        "Tyrion: ……有什么我没发现的事。",
        "Tyrion: 但我已经很接近了。",
        "Tyrion: 还缺少一块把所有事情联系起来的拼图。",
        "Lucio: ……不管怎样。[p/]我们还是不知道“无序女皇”是谁。",
        "Lucio: 我坚决不会让这种人在维文加德逍遥。",
        "Tyrion: 巨龙殿下。[p/]您在维文加德和魔力出现伊始就已在世。",
        "Tyrion: 您知道这个恶魔是谁吗？",
        "Rath: 并不知道……",
        "Rath: 恶魔一生会多次改变头衔。",
        "Rath: ……不管这个女皇是谁，[p/]敢这样侵犯我的领域也是好胆量。",
        "Tyrion: ……哎，[p/]看来我们只能顺其自然了。",
        "Rath: 我们今天已经获取了很多信息。[p/]但从中也衍生出更多问题。",
        "Rath: 应该怎么继续呢？",
        "Tyrion: ……唔呃。",
        "Rath: ……怎么了，卡斯伯特先生？",
        "Tyrion: 我总觉得有什么错过的事。",
        "Tyrion: 但我不知道是什么。",
        "Rath: 我们也纠结这件事好一阵子了。",
        "Rath: 也许应该暂时休庭，整理线索。",
        "Lucio: 哼……[p/]检方没有意见。",
        "Lucio: 这也能让[i]我的[/i]人检查今天的新发现。",
        "Rath: 就这么定了。",
        "Rath: 审理暂时推迟。",
        "Rath: 但明天早上大家要返回这里继续。",
        "Lucio: 你们现在都可以回家了。",
        "Lucio: 但别误会！",
        "Lucio: 国王卫队[i]会[/i]仔细关注你们[i]所有人[/i]。",
        "你还是感觉如芒在背。",
        "Celeste: 喂……[p/]提利昂？",
        "感觉自己忘记了重要的事情。",
        "Celeste: ……提利昂？",
        "是什么？什么这么重要却难以回想？！",
        "Celeste: 提利昂！",
        "Tyrion: 哦、[p/][s/]哦！[p/][s/]不、[p/][s/]不好意思……",
        "Tyrion: 我在思考发生的事。",
        "Celeste: 你看起来累坏了。[p/]要不要回家休息？",
        "Tyrion: 不……[p/]离下次庭审只有一天时间。",
        "Tyrion: 如果不能在明天之前弄明白发生了什么，[p/]魔法痕迹就会消失。",
        "Celeste: 但你已经[i]知道[/i]发生了什么，只是不知道犯人。",
        "Tyrion: 可能吧……[p/]我们应该再和嫌疑人谈一谈。",
        "Tyrion: 运气好的话，[p/]荷鲁斯之眼能告诉我什么事。",
        "Celeste: 可嫌疑人之一是夺眼者……",
        "Celeste: 他的话怎么办？",
        "Tyrion: ……只能也和他谈谈了。",
        "Celeste: 什么？！[p/][s/]不行！",
        "Celeste: 他再想杀你怎么办？！",
        "Tyrion: 阿莉亚命悬一线。",
        "Tyrion: 我只能冒这个险。",
        "Celeste: 提、[p/][s/]提利昂……[p/]你知道自己什么处境吗？",
        "Tyrion: ……什么？",
        "Celeste: 有人杀害了几个贵族，[p/]还攻击了皇室成员。",
        "Celeste: 古龙和恶魔领主也被卷进来了。",
        "Celeste: 这超出你的能力范围了吧？",
        "Tyrion: ……",
        "Tyrion: 痛诶。",
        "Celeste: 你[i]知道[/i]我不是那个意思。",
        "Celeste: 我只是说这事儿太[i]邪门[/i]了！",
        "Tyrion: 没关系的。[p/]和其他我们调查过的事一样。",
        "Celeste: 不一样！",
        "Celeste: 无序女皇攻击你怎么办？",
        "Celeste: 签约人觉得你太接近真相的话怎么办？！",
        "Celeste: 万……[p/][s/]万一我保护不了……？",
        "她的声音开始颤抖。",
        "Tyrion: 塞莱斯特……？",
        "Tyrion: ……",
        "Tyrion: 你[i]还在[i]担心之前的事？",
        "Tyrion: 没事的。[p/]我也说了你没有做错。",
        "Celeste: ……",
        "Celeste: 提利昂，你差点死了。",
        "Tyrion: ……我知道。",
        "Celeste: 提利昂……",
        "Celeste: 你。[p/][s/]差点。[p/][s/]死了！",
        "Tyrion: [i]我明白[/i]。塞莱斯特。",
        "Celeste: 不对！[p/][s/]你不明白！",
        "Celeste: 你知道她越过我离开时我有多担心？！",
        "Celeste: 看到你躺在地上……我、[p/][s/]我……",
        "Celeste: 我想了好多好多事……",
        "Celeste: 如果你真的……我不知道自己会……",
        "她甚至说不完那句话。",
        "Tyrion: 塞莱斯特……[p/]我……",
        "你太专注于其他事，忽视了她的感受。",
        "她被阿莉亚攻击，也差点死了。",
        "你甚至没想过这会给她造成多严重的创伤。",
        "Tyrion: ……",
        "Tyrion: ……对不起。[p/]我没有……",
        "Celeste: 别道歉。[p/]但[i]求你了[/i]……",
        "Celeste: 让卢西奥和鳞甲领主来处理吧。",
        "Celeste: 你做得够多了。[p/]他们可以解决之后的事。",
        "Tyrion: ……",
        "Tyrion: ……如果他们解决不了呢？",
        "Celeste: 我……",
        "Tyrion: 我也不会目中无人到觉得没了我就不行。",
        "Tyrion: 可他们要是[i]找不出[/i]签约人呢？",
        "Tyrion: 阿莉亚余生都要承受牢狱之灾。",
        "Tyrion: 如果我能帮她避免这个命运呢？",
        "Celeste: 我……",
        "Celeste: 我不在乎……",
        "Tyrion: 塞莱斯特！",
        "Celeste: 我不在乎，提利昂！",
        "Celeste: 之后我怎么对她道歉都可以！",
        "Celeste: 但我只想要你平安！",
        "Celeste: ……我不知道自己还会不会坚持下去。",
        "此话一出，[i]她自己[/i]也被吓到了……",
        "Celeste: ……我、[p/][s/]我很抱歉。[p/]我不是要——",
        "Tyrion: ……",
        "Tyrion: 我生命中有你真的很开心。",
        "Celeste: ……什、[p/][s/]什么？！",
        "Tyrion: 我知道你是关心我才这么说。",
        "Tyrion: 最近对你关心不够我也很抱歉。但是……",
        "Celeste: ……你不会停下来的，对吧。",
        "Tyrion: 我一直这么说……",
        "Celeste: *叹气*[p/]人、[p/]王、[p/]亦或是神。谁都不能阻止你为了委托人追求正义。",
        "Celeste: ……",
        "Celeste: 我去和卢西奥谈谈。",
        "Tyrion: 什么？",
        "Celeste: 如果要和夺眼者再会，[p/]就要带上骑士以防万一。",
        "Tyrion: 塞莱斯特……[p/]不是这么——",
        "Celeste: 不行！[p/][s/]你没有决定权！",
        "Celeste: 如果你趁我不在偷偷跑掉，[p/]我也[i]一定会[/i]找到你。",
        "从表情来看，[p/]她是认真的。",
        "Tyrion: 好、[p/][s/]好吧。[p/]你快去。",
        "不过她也有道理……",
        "这些事情发生前，[p/]你也不确定自己想不想继续当律师。",
        "一切结束后也许应该换种更安全，更宁静的生活。",
        "……和她一起生活。",
        "……",
        "等等……[p/][s/]想什么呢？！",
        "Celeste: 好了。[p/]卢西奥同意了。",
        "Celeste: 没想到说服他这么容易。",
        "Tyrion: 喔、[p/][s/]哦……[p/]呃、[p/][s/]唔嗯……",
        "Celeste: ……你没事吧？",
        "Tyrion: 没、[p/][s/]没事……[p/]我们快走吧。",
        "在她回答之前，[p/]你就快步走开了。",
        "Celeste: 等！[p/][s/]别走这么远！",
        "为了救出阿莉亚，得专心于准备庭审。",
        "但一切结束之后，也许可以……",
        "……",
        "嗯、[p/][s/]嗯……[p/]现在先不想这些。",
        "Rath: ……",
        "Eris: 你好呀，巨龙大人。[p/]我们应该是初次见面。",
        "Eris: ……你比我想的小只喔。",
        "Rath: ……",
        "Gallery：这个女的是谁？！",
        "Gallery: 怎么能带[i]普通人[/i]见鳞甲领主？",
        "Tyrion: 旁听的人们。[p/]感谢你们耐心等待。",
        "Tyrion: 至今，[p/]我们都以为这位女性叫厄莉斯·伊尔马特。",
        "Tyrion: 屠杀发生后，[p/]我们一直在寻找真正的幕后黑手。",
        "Tyrion: 我们只知道阿莉亚与叫做“无序女皇”的恶魔签订了血契。",
        "Tyrion: 但对这个恶魔知之甚少。",
        "Tyrion: 我们不知道这个恶魔是谁，长什么样。",
        "Tyrion: 但现在我们知道真相了。",
        "Tyrion: 维文加德高贵的人们。[p/]证人席上的女性[i]不是[/i]普通人。",
        "Tyrion: 她就是无序女皇！",
        "Tyrion: 我不明白[i]原理[/i]。但她利用了人类的形态。",
        "Tyrion: 借此伪装，[p/]她以比亚特丽丝·弗雷加向导的身份进入大教堂。",
        "Tyrion: 之后她利用比亚特丽丝·弗雷加，协助操控阿莉亚·斯蒂尔文德的签约人杀害贵族。",
        "Lucio: 还需要继续吗？",
        "Lucio: 她已经承认自己参加了屠杀！",
        "Lucio: 只要逼问出签约人是谁就结束了！",
        "Eris: 哎呦，[p/]太典了。",
        "Eris: 以为暴力能解决[i]一切[/i]问题的大将军。",
        "Eris: 那我问问你。[p/]你怎么就觉得签约人是人类？",
        "Tyrion: ……什么？",
        "Eris: 在阿莉亚的契约里，[p/]“签约人”是[i]给予[/i]她合同的个体。",
        "Eris: 你怎么知道[i]我[/i]不是这个“个体”？",
        "Eris: 我有很多名字。[p/]“无序女皇”只是其中之一。",
        "Lucio: 哼……[p/]即使你没撒谎，[p/]也只是让事情更简单。",
        "Lucio: 我们只要因对王国的罪而执行[i]你的[/i]死刑即可。",
        "Eris: 你这脑袋已经忘了弗雷加案里我的属下说过什么？",

        "Eris: 但你得知她其实是和我签约血契后。",

        "Lucio: ……",

        "Eris: ……也很好奇你还能坚持多久。",
        "Eris: 没错。[p/]我就是幕后主使。",
        "Eris: 我知道国王的葬礼在大教堂举办。[p/]就强迫比亚特丽丝·弗雷加让我和她同行。",
        "Eris: 到达之后，[p/]我利用自己与比亚特丽丝·弗雷加和阿莉亚·斯蒂尔文德的契约，操控她们行动。",
        "Eris: 通过比亚特丽丝·弗雷加和阿莉亚·斯蒂尔文德的行动，[p/]我协助杀害了洛伊德·冯·桑克图斯，[p/]卡洛琳·希比尔，[p/]加里克·皮尔斯。",
        "Eris: 我唯一的动机就是要伤害提利昂·卡斯伯特的朋友，使他痛苦。",

        "Eris: 当然啦。[p/]我可是个恶魔。",
        "Eris: 既然撒不了谎，[p/]那我觉得还是尽量详细好一点。",
        "Eris: 这样的话也不会有质疑空间。",
        "Eris: 是不是妙极了，提利昂？",
        "唔呃……[p/]她肯定在耍你。",
        "她也许不能说谎。[p/]但这么做也绝不是出于好心。",
        "应该更仔细检查她的证言。",
        "Eris: 没错。[p/]我就是幕后主使。",

        "Eris: 哎呀，[p/]比亚特丽丝·弗雷加和阿莉亚·斯蒂尔文德帮了不少忙。",
        "Eris: 所以不能算独立。",
        "Tyrion: 你知道我什么意思。",
        "Eris: 我懂，我懂。[p/]这不是忍不住吗。",
        "Eris: 简单来说，[p/]那天没有人类[i]自愿[/i]协助我执行计划。",
        "你知道她[i]不能[/i]说谎。",
        "但她还是有很多欺骗别人的经验。",
        "应该时刻保持警惕。",
        "Eris: 我知道国王的葬礼在大教堂举办。[p/]就强迫比亚特丽丝·弗雷加让我和她同行。",
        "Tyrion: ……你是怎么知道的？[p/]这理应是个被严格保守的秘密。",
        "Eris: 噢，提利昂。[p/]我不可能对你和盘托出的呀，对不对？",

        "Tyrion: 省省吧。[p/]我们[i]都[/i]知道阿莉亚不是在自愿知情前提下签约的。",
        "Eris: ……这不是你的一厢情愿？",
        "Tyrion: ……什么？",
        "Eris: 你怎么就知道她签约时不知情？",

        "Eris: 真的？[p/]那要是我拿她未婚夫要挟呢？",
        "Lucio: ……",
        "Eris: 你可能觉得阿莉亚是什么正义使者。",
        "Eris: 但每个人都有自己的临界点。",
        "Tyrion: 如果你所言非虚，[p/]就告诉我们阿莉亚签约的详情吧。",
        "Eris: ……",
        "如你所料。[p/]她只是试图让你慌乱。",
        "即使是为了保护阿斯特，[p/]阿莉亚也绝对不会签这种契约。",
        "Eris: 通过比亚特丽丝·弗雷加和阿莉亚·斯蒂尔文德的行动，[p/]我协助杀害了洛伊德·冯·桑克图斯，[p/]卡洛琳·希比尔，[p/]加里克·皮尔斯。",
        "Tyrion: 为什么要用全名？",
        "Eris: 因为我不能说谎呀。[p/]那不如就说详细点。",
        "Eris: 因为嘛，[p/]和我签约的[p/]斯蒂尔文德一族与弗雷加一组成员[p/]多的是[p/]。",
        "Eris: 多到数不清喔。",
        "Lucio: ……",
        "Tyrion: 卢西奥，别理她。[p/]她故意要激怒你。",
        "Tyrion: 总之……[p/]除开皮尔斯，冯·桑克图斯和希比尔都是维文加德贵族圈的重要人物。",
        "Tyrion: 为什么要把他们三人一起杀了？",
        "Eris: 嗯……[p/]我没有理由。",
        "Tyrion: ……什么？",
        "Eris: 我没有杀他们的理由。[p/]只是[i]恰好[/i]帮他们去死了。",

        "Tyrion: 但这没道理啊！",
        "Eris: 是没有。",

        "Eris: 有帮助吧？",
        "Tyrion: 我……[p/]好吧……[p/]可能吧。",

        "Eris: 我要杀[i]他们[/i]没有特定的理由。[p/]我只需要阿莉亚尽可能高效快速地杀掉我要杀的人。",
        "Tyrion: 我们已经知道皮尔斯是因知道塞莱斯特亲生父母的身份被杀。",
        "Tyrion: 你怎么可能没有杀人动机？！",
        "Eris: ……这不是你的一厢情愿？",
        "Tyrion: 不是的！[p/][s/]这是唯一合理的结论！",
        "Eris: 这就是你的错了。",
        "Eris: 怎么能假定我的行为出于逻辑思考呢。",
        "Tyrion: ……",
        "你有点黔驴技穷了……",
        "之前调查过的谋杀案都有逻辑可循，你可以在此基础上推理。",

        "目前来看，[p/]她狂得毫无逻辑。",

        "Eris: 杀人实在是太[i]容易[/i]了。[p/]小孩子都能做到。",

        "Tyrion: ……",

        "Celeste: 说了谎很抱歉……[p/]但我必须有不在场证明。",
        "Tyrion: 塞莱斯特！[p/][s/]裁判所是因为[i]你的[/i]证言才逮捕了她！",
        "Rath: ……阿拉里克王子和议长的证言也都指向她。",
        "Rath: 斯蒂尔文德小姐也知道自己口袋里发现的紫色标记很可疑。",
        "Rath: 不管有没有麦考伊的证言，[p/]事情走向都不会变。",
        "Lucio: ……",
        "Lucio: 麦考伊，你发现她们的时候，弗雷加和恶魔在干什么？",
        "Celeste: 她们骗过我进了祷告室……[p/]这之后，[p/]比亚特丽丝……[p/]杀害了你。",
        "Tyrion: 她们怎么能这么轻易骗过你？",
        "Celeste: 我出去看怎么回事的时候，[p/]只看到比亚特丽丝和厄莉斯站在守卫的尸体旁边。",
        "Celeste: 她们表现得像是凶手[i]另有其人[/i]。",
        "Celeste: 然后他们谎称进祷告室是要保护里面的人。",
        "Celeste: 比亚特丽丝……[p/]就是这时……",
        "Tyrion: ……",
        "Tyrion: 比亚特丽斯怎么杀的我？",
        "Celeste: 她对你用了某种[b]死灵术[/b] ，[p/]但没有造成外伤。",
        "Celeste: 我检查时[p/]你的尸体已经变冷……[p/]心跳也停止了。",
        "Celeste: 我认为她用了[b]索命咒[/b]。",
        "Tyrion: 所以阿斯克勒庇俄斯勋爵会说我身上有[b]死灵术[/b]的痕迹。",
        "她说尝试治疗你肯定也是撒谎。",
        "Tyrion: ……我死后你做了什么？",
        "Celeste: ……",
        "Celeste: 我不知道怎么办。[p/]这时厄莉斯跟我说，她能复活你，但我要杀掉皮尔斯。",
        "Tyrion: ……我不觉得她一开始就是这个目的。",
        "Tyrion: 她想让你和她签约。[p/]都是为了让[i]我[/i]痛苦。",
        "Celeste: 提利昂……[p/]我真的——！",
        "Tyrion: 别说了。",
        "Tyrion: 不要……[p/]说了。",
        "Tyrion: 我……",
        "Celeste: 我知道自己不应该这么做。[p/]但我只想让你回来……[p/]我不在乎自己会变成什么样。",
        "Tyrion: 你怎么能觉得这样没问题？！",
        "Celeste: 我知道自己不对……[p/]但我没办法……",
        "Celeste: 对不起。[p/]我不知道怎么办。",
        "Lucio: ……",
        "Rath: 现在不是谴责她的时候，卡斯伯特先生。",
        "Rath: ……之后还有很多时间。",
        "Tyrion: ……",
        "Celeste: 我没想到她会利用“永世服从”这点来操控我。[p/]她利用我骗阿莉亚签了[i]另一份[/i]血契。",
        "Tyrion: 确实……[p/]这一部分写得有点让人误会。",
        "Lucio: 她肯定以为女皇会把她召入地狱当仆从。",
        "Lucio: 但恶魔却选择立刻操控麦考伊。",
        "Lucio: ……你不该相信恶魔的。",
        "Celeste: ……",
        "Tyrion: ……总之，[p/]你是怎么骗阿莉亚签约血契的？",
        "Celeste: 是的……我没法控制自己的行动。[p/]但我记得发生了什么。",
        "Celeste: 她可能[i]想[/i]让我亲眼看到自己做了什么。",
        "Celeste: 我、[p/][s/]我真的……[p/][s/]真的很抱歉……",
        "Rath: ……",
        "Celeste: 我对阿莉亚说皮尔斯愿意用我父母的信息换取减刑。",
        "Celeste: 厄莉斯让比亚特丽丝对契约施加了[b]幻象术[/b]，让内容看起来像是要求上诉。",
        "Celeste: ……由于皮尔斯被控杀害我的父亲，[p/]她尊重我的意愿。",
        "……等等。[p/]她刚才说的有什么根本上的错误。",
        "Celeste: 在这之后……[p/]我按照契约里对[i]我[/i]的要求行动。[p/]为了让提利昂复活，我杀了皮尔斯。",
        "Tyrion: 这不是……",
        "Tyrion: 你怎么能觉得我会接受这种事，塞莱斯特？！",
        "Celeste: 我知道你不会。[p/][s/]但这不公平！",
        "Celeste: 为什么[i]那种人[/i]可以活着而你非死不可？",

        "Celeste: ……什么？",
        "Tyrion: 可能厄莉斯改变过[i]我的[/i]记忆，[p/][s/]但这跟改变一件实体证据可不一样！",
        "Lucio: 可我们还不清楚她的所有能力。[p/]真的能排除这个可能性吗？",
        "Lucio: 你当时失去了意识。[p/]伊尔马特有充足的时间修改记忆[i]并[/i]浏览你的随身物品。",

        "Celeste: 跟着她进入祷告室后，[p/]我发现比亚特丽丝和厄莉斯也在屋内。[p/]她们使阿莉亚、[p/]提利昂，[p/]还有皮尔斯失去了意识。",

        "Celeste: 皮尔斯死亡几分钟后，[p/]阿斯特、[p/]裁判所和国王卫队到场逮捕阿莉亚。",

        "Tyrion: 即使[i]看起来[/i]没什么重要的事，[p/]我还是希望进行交叉讯问。",
        "Lucio: 唔……[p/]那你开始吧。",
        "Celeste: 现在我想起来了。[p/]我们下午 1:50 去和皮尔斯见面。[p/]下午 2:20 听到外面的骚乱。",
        "Tyrion: 没错……[p/]我们已经确认会面时间[i]是[/i]下午 2:00。",
        "Celeste: 对……[p/]她只改变了我的记忆，妄图骗过所有人。",
        "Tyrion: 考虑到[i]我的[/i]记忆完好无缺，[p/]她的力量肯定无法改变别人的记忆。",
        "Lucio: 是的……[p/]她也没有用自己的恶魔之力复活你。",
        "Lucio: 她只是操控比亚特丽丝用了[b]假死[/b]法术。",
        "Celeste: ……不敢相信我会被这骗了。",
        "Tyrion: 总之……[p/]你看到了谁攻击看守？[p/]是阿莉亚或者比亚特丽丝吗？",
        "Celeste: 我看见阿莉亚在攻击看守。[p/]我和她缠斗了大概 15 分钟，才被她逃走。",
        "Tyrion: 一开始，[p/]你口中自己和她搏斗的时间长得[i]多[/i]。",
        "Celeste: 是的。[p/]我必须把自己和厄莉斯交谈的时间也算在内。",
        "Lucio: 我就[i]感觉[/i]哪里不对。",
        "Celeste: 我知道提利昂会很关注谋杀时间线的细节。",
        "Celeste: 所以我必须让自己的证言和皮尔斯死亡事件一致。",
        "Tyrion: ……",
        "Celeste: ……我[i]真的[/i]很抱歉。",
        "Tyrion: ……这个我们之后谈。",
        "Celeste: ……",
        "Celeste: 跟着她进入祷告室后，[p/]我发现比亚特丽丝和厄莉斯也在屋内。[p/]她们使阿莉亚、[p/]提利昂，[p/]还有皮尔斯失去了意识。",
        "Tyrion: 所以比亚特丽丝在你们搏斗时偷偷溜进去这点没错。",
        "Celeste: 对……[p/]现在想想，[p/]可能是为了转移我的注意，让比亚特丽丝潜入。",
        "Tyrion: 嗯……",
        "Lucio: 怎么了，卡斯伯特？",
        "Tyrion: 如果签约人在和厄莉斯[i]合作[/i]，为什么不让厄莉斯操控比亚特丽丝使阿莉亚昏迷？",
        "Celeste: 我没考虑过这点……",
        "Lucio: ……说实话，[p/]我很难相信签约人会乐意遵照女皇复杂的计划。",
        "Lucio: 签约人明显[i]需要[/i]皮尔斯去死。[p/]只靠麦考伊有点太蠢了。",
        "确实……[p/]有没有可能是厄莉斯不照计划行事？",
        "她确实不像那种会乖乖听人类指示的恶魔。",
        "Tyrion: ……总之，[p/]你看到失去意识的我之后发生了什么？",
        "Celeste: ……我检查了提利昂，认为他死了。[p/]但现在想想，比亚特丽丝可能对他用了[b]假死[/b]。",
        "Lucio: ……你会中这么明显的骗术真令我难以置信。",
        "Celeste: 我知道……[p/]我当时太害怕了。",
        "Celeste: 我以为提利昂死了。[p/]我脑袋不清醒。",
        "Tyrion: ……很高兴你这么在乎我。",
        "Tyrion: ……但你也几乎毁掉了阿莉亚的前程。",
        "Celeste: ……",
        "Rath: ……也许还是要专注于事实。",
        "Celeste: 总之，[p/]厄莉斯向我提出交易。[p/]但我受不了要杀皮尔斯……[p/]你们也知道后续。",
        "Lucio: ……一份血契竟然能对调查有这么大影响。",
        "Celeste: 我早该知道她有其他打算……[p/]但我当时太急迫了，意识不到。",

        "Lucio: ……",
        "鳞甲领主对她一直很温柔……",
        "Celeste: 皮尔斯死亡几分钟后，[p/]阿斯特、[p/]裁判所和国王卫队到场逮捕阿莉亚。",
        "Lucio: 一定是在他们去调查公共休息室火势之后。",
        "Tyrion: 我没想到阿斯特也去了祷告室。[p/]我还以为国王卫队会让他留在某个安全地点。",
        "Lucio: ……我的命令确实如此。",

        "Tyrion: ……",
        "Lucio: 需要我提醒你时间[i]所剩无几[/i]吗？",
        "Lucio: 不要浪费时间了，有话就说！",
        "Tyrion: ……塞莱斯特。[p/]加里克·皮尔斯在下午 2:45 身亡，[i]阿斯特[/i]几分钟后就现身祷告室。",
        "Celeste: 对……[p/]你想说什——？",
        "Celeste: 等等……",
        "Tyrion: 这就产生一个大问题。",
        "Tyrion: 阿斯特怎么能在下午 2:45 前后进祷告室的？",
        "Tyrion: ……明明他直到[i]下午 3:00[/i] 都[i]应该[/i]被困在[b]坚牢术[/b]里！",
        "Lucio: ……！",
        "Celeste: 等、[p/][s/]等等……[p/][s/]你在说笑吧？！",
        "Lucio: 麦、[p/][s/]麦考伊的记忆明显不可靠！",
        "Lucio: 我的人[i]一致[/i]报告说，国王陛下在[b]坚牢术[/b]解除[i]之后[/i]才带他们去了祷告室。",
        "Tyrion: 一般而言……[p/]这[i]会[/i]比塞莱斯特的证言更可靠。",
        "Tyrion: 但我们不能相信他们的证言。",
        "Lucio: 你在说什么？！",
        "Tyrion: 在我检查塞莱斯特的契约时，[p/]厄莉斯表示她和多名卫队成员也签了契约。",
        "Lucio: 什么？！",
        "Tyrion: 他们也与她同流合污。",
        "Tyrion: 如果这些契约和塞莱斯特的契约组内容相似，[p/]她肯定也能改变这些人的记忆。",
        "Tyrion: 也就意味着他们被讯问时可能有意[i]或[/i]无意撒谎。",
        "Rath: 竟然……[p/]就连[i]国王卫队[/i]也遭毒手……",
        "Rath: 我怎么会让这种事发生……？",
        "Tyrion: 即使我们假定他能逃出[i]无法逃脱的[/i][b]坚牢术[/b]，[p/]阿斯特又是怎么[i]知道[/i]要去祷告室的？",
        "Lucio: 我、[p/][s/]我明白你的论点……",
        "Lucio: 但你[i]明白[/i]自己在暗示什么吗？！",
        "Tyrion: 我不是想暗示什么。[p/]我只是在陈述已知事实。",
        "Tyrion: 我们知道一个人类，[p/]不论是自愿还是其他原因，[p/]与无序女皇一起谋划了这场屠杀。",
        "Tyrion: 他深得阿莉亚·斯蒂尔文德信任。",
        "Tyrion: 信任到她甚至不[i]多想[/i]就签了他递过来的契约。",
        "Tyrion: 只有一个满足这些条件的人……",
        "Tyrion: ……阿斯特·维文加德：[p/][s/]我们的现任国王！",
        "Rath: 肃静！[p/][s/]我让你们肃静！",
        "Rath: ……",
        "Rath: 卡斯伯特先生……[p/]你明白这一指控的重大意义吗？",
        "Rath: 指控国王和任何恶魔同谋犯案，[p/]都不是小事。",
        "Tyrion: 我明白。[p/]但我[i]希望[/i]这只是个误会。",
        "Tyrion: 毕竟，[p/]厄莉斯的目的似乎只是尽可能收获混乱无序。",
        "Tyrion: 她骗我们相信塞莱斯特和阿莉亚[i]都是[/i]杀人犯。",
        "Tyrion: 我想救阿莉亚。[p/]但我也想相信愿意信任我的人们。",
        "Tyrion: 如果阿斯特有什么能救阿莉亚的情报，[p/]我们就必须找出来。",
        "Rath: ……那好吧。",
        "Rath: 看来只有这么做了，[p/]事已至此，[p/]国王也必须分享他的真相。",
        "Tyrion: 我同意。[p/]这一点我也不会让步。",
        "Lucio: ……",
        "Lucio: 国王卫队！[p/][s/]护送国王陛下上证人席！",

        "Aster: 当然。[p/]我明白你的处境，卡斯伯特先生。",
        "Tyrion: 我希望你能就阿莉亚一开始怎么会签约血契做出说明。",
        "Tyrion: 厄莉斯有可能骗了你，导致[i]你[/i]实施屠杀。",
        "Tyrion: 尽管证据指向这里，[p/]但一定有什么我们还没发现的东西。",
        "Aster: 证据？[p/]你说的是塞莱斯特的证言。[p/]我没说错吧？",
        "Aster: 很抱歉这么说，[p/]但是……",
        "Aster: 你确定我们能相信她的证言？",
        "Tyrion: 我们现在可以相信她。",
        "Tyrion: 她已经不受血契影响了。",

        "Aster: 对不起，卡斯伯特先生。[p/]我想说的是……",
        "Aster: 发生刚才这些事后，[p/]我们怎么能相信你？",
        "Tyrion: ……什么？",
        "Aster: 你消失了好一阵子，[p/]去了[i]谁都不知道[/i]的地方。",
        "Aster: 与你同行的只有塞莱斯特和一个能改变别人记忆的[i]恶魔[/i]。",
        "Aster: 你一回来，这个恶魔[i]马上[/i]就燃烧殆尽，对你[i]有点[/i]太方便了？",
        "Aster: 她也说过好几次。[p/]这样做不能[i]真的[/i]杀掉她。",
        "Tyrion: 我、[p/][s/]我……",
        "Aster: [i]现在[/i]……[p/]你又要指控我是签约人，[p/]那个要对谋杀冯·桑克图斯和希比尔负责的人。",
        "Aster: 如果恶魔把你也控制了，[p/]这不就[i]正是[/i]她想要的？",
        "Rath: ……",
        "Gallery: ……说得对啊！",
        "Gallery: 我们怎么知道“天诞之物”值得信任？！",
        "Gallery: 我们都听说过那些故事！[p/][s/]他明显是个异见人士！",

        "Aster: 对、[p/][s/]对不起！[p/][s/]我不是要攻击做了这么多的你。",
        "Aster: 不过我想还有[i]一种[/i]方法能确认你的理论。",
        "Tyrion: ...And what's that?",
        "Aster: Use your Divine Edict on me.[p/] Just like you've done several times before.",
        "Aster: If I truly [i]was[/i] in league with that demon,[p/] shouldn't I have a Contract with her?",
        "Aster: It will appear.[p/] Even if I was made to forget about it.",

        "Celeste: Wait...[p/] That's right!",
        "Celeste: We already tried that before and it didn't work!",

        "Aster: ...",
        "Aster: I'm sorry, Mr. Cuthbert.[p/] I know you care deeply for her.",

        "Celeste: We just proved my Blood Contract wasn’t valid.",
        "Celeste: But the one who made Aria commit those murders is still out there.",
        "Maybe you’ve been thinking about this the wrong way.",
        "Eris found ways to trick people into signing Blood Contracts before.",
        "So she wouldn’t necessarily [i]need[/i] a Blood Contract to trick Aster into accidentally helping her.",
        "The question isn't whether Aster knowingly did this or not.",
        "The question is...",
        "There had to have been [i]some[/i] sort of physical involvement on his part.",

        "But there [i]is[/i] one thing that he definitely needed to do himself.",
        "Tyrion: He needed to trick Aria into signing the Contract somehow...",
        "Celeste: ...But you've seen how she is around him.",
        "Celeste: That wouldn't have been very hard to do.",
        "Tyrion: No...[p/] Aria may be extremely lovesick around him,[p/] but she's still an attorney.",
        "Tyrion: She would be careful to read [i]any[/i] contract she signed.",
        "Tyrion: We deduced earlier that her Blood Contract was disguised as a normal legal document.",
        "Tyrion: And I remember something.[p/] When you caught a glimpse of it,[p/] you immediately started teasing her.",

        "Tyrion: ...The Patron controlled Aria and committed each of the murders without having to do [i]anything[/i] personally.",
        "Tyrion: But this was all contingent on tricking her into [i]signing[/i] that Contract in the first place.",
        "Tyrion: I recall that you went to a meeting with the High Speaker right [i]before[/i] the massacre started.",
        "Tyrion: It was to discuss your marriage to Aria, wasn't it?",
        "Aster: ...Yes.[p/] That's correct.",
        "Tyrion: Aster,[p/] the Blood Contract that Aria signed needed to [i]look[/i] like a normal legal document.",

        "Tyrion: The language used would've made sense under a [i]different[/i] context.",
        "Tyrion: In that Contract,[p/] Aria gave you her \"mind,[p/] body,[p/] and soul\".",

        "Aster: Y-[p/]Yes...[p/] I'm well aware of them...",
        "Tyrion: ...And did you know Aria took a picture of the marriage license she signed?",
        "Aster: ...What?",
        "Tyrion: She was so happy to finally have your union codified,[p/] that she took a picture of your \"marriage license\".",
        "Tyrion: ...Even though it was [i]technically[/i] illegal to do so.",
        "Aster: ...S-[p/][s/]She-![p/][s/] Why would she-?!",
        "Tyrion: The moment she regained consciousness,[p/] she thought she was a danger to others.",
        "Tyrion: She had [i]no[/i] memories of what she did that day,[p/] but she knew something was wrong.",
        "Tyrion: That's why she locked herself in a cell with an [b]Anti-Magic Field[/b].",

        "Aster: *sigh*[p/] Don't bother.",
        "Tyrion: No...[p/] So it really [i]was[/i] you.",
        "Aster: ...Tell me, Mr. Cuthbert.[p/] Do you know what the best kind of lie is?",
        "Tyrion: The kind that's hardest to disprove.",
        "Aster: No...[p/] Not quite.",

        "Aster: I'm done with this farce.",
        "Aster: I'm sure if we brought the High Speaker to the stand,[p/] Cuthbert would just [i]deduce[/i] what happened anyways.",

        "Tyrion: He needed both you [i]and[/i] Pierce to die during the massacre.",
        "Tyrion: Which means you two were [i]just[/i] as important targets as von Sanctus and Sibyl.",
        "Celeste: Okay...?[p/] But my potential claim to the throne would be the only reason why he'd be scared of me.",
        "Celeste: If [i]that[/i] wasn't a problem,[p/] why would he be so scared of Pierce's blackmail?",
        "Would the line of succession be the [i]only[/i] reason why he'd be scared of Celeste's parentage?",

        "Theon: Faith is a powerful and unifying force.",
        "Tyrion: ...Is that why you revise Wyverngarde's history and keep heavensborn outside the country?",
        "Theon: I don't know [i]what[/i] you're trying to insinuate. [mind=\"Hmph... Dissidents like him will be the end of our culture.\"/]",

        "Beatrice: Yes.[p/] The luminites worship the celestial gods,[p/] while [i]our[/i] people worship the ancient dragons.",
        "Beatrice: A few centuries ago,[p/] our nation was locked in a bitter war with the luminites.",
        "Beatrice: Even now,[p/] the crown sees the celestial religions as a threat to our draconic culture.",
        "Beatrice: The church has done its best to wipe out any religions that worship the Celestials.",
        "Hm...[p/] If Aster's actions had anything to do with the Theocracy,[p/] he would've targeted you,[p/] not Celeste.",

        "TYRION: Wow…[p/] I had no idea.",
        "TYRION: How have I never heard of this before?",
        "ERIS: To be honest,[p/] that law is just a way to revere him and appease the church.",

        "Celeste: They'd definitely betray you the first chance they got.",
        "Harold: Well, legends say that demons often drafted Blood Contracts for this reason.",
        "Tyrion: Wait...[p/] Do you mean like a [i]legally binding[/i] contract?",
        "Harold: The concept is similar.[p/] But once you sign a Blood Contract,[p/] both you and the demon are magically compelled to fulfill its terms.",
        "Harold: It's said that violating its terms will result in instant death for the offender...[p/] No matter who it is.",
        "Tyrion: So I guess there's [i]some[/i] protection...",
        "Harold: Well...[p/] As an attorney,[p/] I'm sure you understand that it's possible to exploit and use loopholes in [i]any[/i] contract.",
        "Harold: And according to the legends,[p/] demons take great pride in their ability to deceive and corrupt people.",
        "Hm...[p/] Aster [i]did[/i] make a deal with the Empress of Discord.",
        "But they never actually made it official with a Blood Contract.",

        "Coraline: That is correct.",
        "Hm...[p/] With three of the Four Pillar House leaders dead,[p/] very few people will be able to challenge Aster.",
        "And since Aria was framed for it,[p/] House Steelwind will probably lose its influence as well.",

        "Beatrice: There's something peaceful about it.",
        "Eris: ...[i]That's[/i] certainly a positive way to look at it.",

        "Beatrice: But to answer your question,[p/] a heavensborn is a human whose bloodline has been touched by the gods.",

        "Aria: House Asclepius specializes in [b]necromancy[/b] magic.",
        "Aria: After his expulsion from the academy,[p/] I thought it was only right that he be allowed to continue his studies.",
        "Celeste: Right.[p/] He mentioned that he owed you a favor.",
        "Aria: It was only logical.[p/] It would be a waste to let someone of his talents fade into obscurity.",

        "Celeste: Well...[p/] I can't just leave him alone anymore.[p/] He ticked off a criminal overlord.",

        "Tyrion: Even if I [i]did[/i] agree to help him,[p/] it would be nearly impossible for me to get him an acquittal.",

        "Celeste: So...[p/] Think about how stressed he would be if you showed up and refused to help him.",

        "She seems to be someone of equal social standing.",
        "You feel like you've seen her somewhere before.[p/] But you can't quite remember where.",
        "As soon as you enter the room,[p/] von Sanctus flashes a quick look of disdain at you.",
        "You see him slowly move his conversation out of the room as well.",
        "And finally,[p/] you see Lucio Steelwind speaking with his daughter.",
        "...along with the two princes.",
        "They seem to speaking with another individual that you haven't met before.",
        "When he notices you,[p/] his gaze narrows.[p/] And he stares at the two of you warily.",
