        "Tyrion: ……什么？",
        "Remus: 我一生犯了许多错误……",
        "Remus: 我给了维文加德自保的手段。[p/]但这一切只让他们被卷入可怕的事里。",
        "Remus: 我所创造的东西也让我苦涩……[p/]所以我把自己和自己的人民分隔开来。",
        "Remus: 我本以为最好的做法就是远离尘世，让维文加德保护自己。",
        "Remus: ……现在我明白自己有多愚蠢。",
        "Remus: 我把自己的血肉抛弃在一个不公的世界。",

        "Tyrion: 你记得她发生了[i]什么事[/i]？",
        "MBeatrice: ……不。[p/]只是直觉。",
        "Lucio: 不需要你的直觉。",
        "Lucio: 告诉我们之后怎么了，弗雷加。",
        "MBeatrice: 我们在花园里交谈，[p/]然后我突然感觉不适，失去了意识。",
        "Tyrion: 如果她们和你一起，[p/]妹妹们怎么没注意到？",
        "Lucio: 拉菲和米莉亚姆证言称，[p/]她们的宠物狗在走廊里乱跑。",
        "Lucio: 她们为了追狗，离开了证人和伊尔马特。",
        "Lucio: 等妹妹们再回到花园，[p/]比亚特丽丝和伊尔马特已经不见了。",
        "MBeatrice: ……",
        "Tyrion: 之后你有[i]任何[/i]记忆吗？",

        "Tyrion: ……而你什么都[i]不记得[/i]。",
        "MBeatrice: 不……[p/]一点都不记得。",
        "MBeatrice: 我只能想象失去意识期间都被迫做了什么。",
        "Tyrion: “被迫”……？[p/]这是什么意思？",
        "MBeatrice: 我很困惑。[p/]但我之后听说了发生的事，[p/]也意识到有人操控了我的身体。",
        "Tyrion: 所以你[i]也[/i]觉得自己被人操控了？",
        "MBeatrice: 是的。[p/]这是你会在祷告室看见我的唯一解释。",
        "Lucio: 荒唐！",
        "Lucio: 奥术[i]做不到[/i]意识操控！",
        "Lucio: 你是在为了脱罪编故事！",
        "你几乎想同意他。",
        "……但为什么还是觉得哪里不对？",
        "MBeatrice: 随你怎么想。",
        "MBeatrice: 但还请相信这一点……",
        "MBeatrice: 我不记得发生了什么。[p/]阿莉亚似乎也有相同遭遇。",
        "Tyrion: 你和我的当事人确实口径一致。",
        "Tyrion: 但你看起来[i]早就知道[/i]她身上发生了什么。",
        "Tyrion: 可能你只是借此编造不在场证明。",
        "MBeatrice: 也不怪你这么想。",
        "MBeatrice: 卡斯伯特先生。[p/]我知道自己没什么信用。[p/]但我[i]现在说的[/i]都是真的。",
        "Tyrion: 拭目以待。",
        "MBeatrice: 更麻烦的是，[p/][i]没有[/i]任何线索指明存在幕后黑手。",
        "Tyrion: ……你怎么会想到这边？",
        "MBeatrice: 这个嘛，[p/]如果有证据证明是[i]别人[/i]进行操控，[p/]我[i]和[/i]阿莉亚都能脱罪。",
        "MBeatrice: 好好想想，卡斯伯特先生。[p/]难道没有",
        "MBeatrice: 这不是最佳结果吗？",
        "MBeatrice: 唉……",
        "Tyrion: ……怎么了？",
        "MBeatrice: 没事。",
        "她看起来被什么惹得不太开心……",
        "Player: Overflow",
        "她的作证方式有点奇怪。",
        "她立马得出了自己被人操控的结论。",
        "还有，为什么要提起阿莉亚的事？",

        "Tyrion: 啊-[p/]哦……[p/] 好像是这样的。",
        "Player: Back",

        "Tyrion: ……比亚特丽丝，[p/]你说没有任何线索证明存在幕后黑手。",
        "Tyrion: 但我这恰好有[i]一件[/i]证据，虽然关联相对微弱。",
        "MBeatrice: ……这件证据是？",
        "Tyrion: [i]这个[/i]符号……",
        "你把画着紫色标记的羊皮纸拿给她看。",
        "MBeatrice: ……",
        "MBeatrice: 马鲁纳斯……[p/]你搞什么鬼？",

        "MBeatrice: ……",
        "MBeatrice: 卡斯伯特先生，我很好奇。[p/]羊皮纸上有什么？",
        "Tyrion: 是这样，比亚特丽丝，[p/]阿莉亚之前在调查维文加德境内的一系列谋杀案。",
        "Tyrion: 这些案子手段残忍，[p/]但是[i]乍一看[/i]互不相关。",
        "Tyrion: 他们其实都有一个共同点。",

        "Lucio: 你这套“意识操控”的说辞就已经蠢到好笑了。",

        "Tyrion: 明显是幕后黑手在挑衅。",

        "MBeatrice：……[p/][s/]唉。",
        "Tyrion: ……比亚特丽丝，没事吧？",

        "刚才发生的什么事值得仔细思考？",
        "马鲁纳斯……[p/]他不想让比亚特丽丝看到紫色标记。",
        "这意味着比亚特丽丝[i]认识[/i]这个标记。",
        "马鲁纳斯是使魔，[i]一般都会[/i]服从她的命令。",

        "Player: Fail",
        "不对……[p/]有一条很明显的线索。",
        "首先，[p/]关于阿莉亚在调查的这个紫色标记，[p/]比亚特丽丝应该知道什么事情。",
        "其次，[p/]马鲁纳斯[i]正在阻止[/i]比亚特丽丝看见这个标记。",
        "作为一个恶魔，他[i]不应该[/i]关心维文加德的政治。",
        "紫色标记肯定和某个恶魔有关。",
        "这是他阻止比亚特丽丝看到标记的唯一解释……",
        "阿莉亚调查的是维文加德[i]境内各处[/i]的谋杀案。",
        "是否意味着她的调查[i]也[/i]和恶魔相关？",
        "……阿莉亚怀疑凶手们都被别人操控了。",

        "Player: Beatrice lost control of their actions due to a Blood Contract",
        "Player: Fail",
        "不对……[p/]你没见过这种意识操控的例子。",
        "但你确实对恶魔知之甚少。",
        "也许恶魔有什么方法能强迫别人行动。",
        "你回忆起了之前比亚特丽丝的契约内容。",
        "上面写了她没能获得弗雷加一族家业的后果。",
        "“她的灵魂，[p/]她的[i]意识[/i]，[p/]和她的生命都会献给无序女皇。”",
        "如果这个“无序女皇”也拥有比亚特丽丝的“意识”，[p/]那是否也能强迫比亚特丽丝行动？",

        "Player: Aria lost control of their mind due to a Blood Contract",
        "Player: Fail",
        "不对……[p/]也许这能解释比亚特丽丝为什么会被操控。",

        "阿莉亚真的和恶魔签订了血契？",
        "但她为什么[i]要[/i]这么做……？",

        "你想不出[i]其他[/i]能让人强迫阿莉亚行动的方法。",
        "……但[i]有[/i]一种不会失败的方法。",
        "神谕。[p/]你在比亚特丽丝的庭审中也用过这个能力。",
        "当时只是本能……[p/]但你现在也更了解个中机制。",
        "你可以创造恶魔和契约持有人的血契副本。",
        "但要想成功，[p/]你得知道契约持有人的名字。",
        "此外，[p/]还需要知道恶魔的名字。",
        "现在，你只能靠猜。",

        "Player: Marrunath",
        "不对……[p/]马鲁纳斯一直跟着比亚特丽丝。",
        "和阿莉亚签约的恶魔很可能也和其他凶手签订了契约。",
        "紫色标记是这个恶魔的什么符号。",

        "Player: Eugene Haroldson",

        "……你还好吗？",

        "Rath: ……你沉默不语好一会儿了，卡斯伯特先生。",

        "Tyrion: 麻烦了……[p/]签约人肯定是为了匿踪消去了你的记忆。",
        "Aria: 但我还是不明白。",
        "Aria: 就算我[i]不记得[/i]签约一事，[p/]我也不会这么大意。",
        "Tyrion: 确实……[p/]虽然不想承认，[p/]但卢西奥说得没错。",
        "Tyrion: 你和我一样是法律工作者。[p/]我们签约前都会仔细浏览内容。",
        "Tyrion: 这也引出了签约人[i]怎么[/i]获得你签名的问题。",
        "Aria: 我不知道……",
        "Aria: 我只是……",
        "Aria: ……",
        "Tyrion: 该死……[p/]我们都不知道你签约的时候是个什么状况。",
        "Tyrion: 我们知道的只有一件事，[p/]签约人可能用了很多把戏让你中招。",
        "Aria: 这个……[p/]也有可能。",
        "Celeste: ……阿莉亚。",
        "在你们讨论的时候，[p/]斯蒂尔文德爵接近了。",

        "Celeste: 你就没什么要说的？！",
        "Aria: ……",
        "虽然没有外露情感……[p/][s/]但你的荷鲁斯之眼确实看到了什么",
        "他几乎像是感到……[p/]悲哀和担忧。",
        "……",
        "……唉，[p/]不管他心里怎么想，[p/]行动已经证明你们是敌对关系。",
        "不管他的动力是[i]什么[/i]，[p/]你都会战胜他。[p/]就像战胜别人那样。",
        "Tyrion: 该回去了，塞莱斯特。",
        "Celeste: 好……",
        "不管要做什么，[p/]你都会坚持到最后。",
        "Rath: 现在审理继续。[p/]就从中断的地方开始吧？",
        "Rath: 你接下来要怎么做？",
        "Tyrion: 我们应该回顾一下关于谋杀案[i]已知[/i]的事情。",
        "Lucio: 哼……[p/]我们确实还有很多目击证人。",
        "Tyrion: 没错……[p/]从最开头说起吧。",
        "Tyrion: 一切都始于昨天中午。",
        "Tyrion: 我，阿莉亚，我的护卫塞莱斯特三人都在我位于瑞斯霍姆的家里。",
        "Tyrion: 我们在谈关于一封突然被寄来的信的事情。",
        "Tyrion: 寄信人是加里克·皮尔斯。[p/]他希望下午2:00，与我和塞莱斯特在鳞甲领主大教堂见面。",
        "Tyrion: 为了确保准时，[p/]我们下午1:00就抵达了大教堂。",
        "Tyrion: 当时我们还不知道，[p/]大教堂已经不对公众开放了。",
        "Tyrion: 但看守大教堂的骑士放我们进去了。",
        "Tyrion: 他们似乎早知道我们会来。",
        "Lucio: ……这[i]不[/i]应该。",
        "Lucio: 出于事态严肃性，[p/]只有个别人被允许进入大教堂。",
        "Tyrion: 可能有人背后牵线让我们进去。",
        "Lucio: ……[i]也可能[/i]是你们俩违法进了大教堂。",
        "Tyrion: 这个嘛，问问国王卫队的骑士不就知道了。",
        "Lucio: 国王卫队的[i]每条[/i]命令我都知晓。",
        "Lucio: [i]没有[/i]哪条说了要放你们通过。",
        "Tyrion: ……我们遇见的骑士可能也是昏迷者之一。",
        "Tyrion: 在他们恢复意识之前，[p/]我们无从得知。",
        "Rath: 我们先继续进行吧……",
        "Lucio: 哼……",
        "Tyrion: 总之，[p/]我们提前抵达教堂，[p/]去见皮尔斯之前的一小时里简单赏景。",
        "Tyrion: 这段时间里，[p/]我们遇见了雷穆斯，[p/]卢西奥，[p/]阿莉亚，[p/]阿斯特，[p/]阿拉里克。",
        "Tyrion: 同一时间，[p/]阿莉亚和阿斯特一起去议长舍与之会面。",
        "Tyrion: 探索大教堂时，[p/]我们还与冯·桑克图斯和希比尔交谈过。",
        "Tyrion: 之后还与弗雷加三姐妹及厄莉斯·伊尔马特交谈。",
        "Lucio: 厄莉斯·伊尔马特？",
        "Tyrion: 她是比亚特丽丝·弗雷加的一个朋友。",
        "Tyrion: 国王卫队不允许她把自己的使魔带进大教堂。",
        "Tyrion: 厄莉斯就充当了她的向导。",
        "Lucio: 嗯……",
        "Tyrion: 总之，[p/]我们下午1:45左右离开花园去祷告室见皮尔斯。",
        "Tyrion: 与此同时，[p/]阿莉亚因感到恶心而离开了与议长的谈话。",
        "Tyrion: 她最后记得的场面是自己看向迦拉克隆湖。",
        "Lucio: 真是个好[i]故事[/i]。",
        "Tyrion: [i]不管怎样[/i]，[p/]下午2:00，[p/]阿斯特去悼念先王。",
        "Tyrion: 但他并不知道，遗棺那里被法师设下了[b]有备无患[/b]法术。",
        "Tyrion: 目的是为了用[b]坚牢术[/b]困住他。",
        "Rath: 真是卑鄙……",
        "Lucio: 考虑到之后发生的事情，[p/]攻击国王陛下可能是为了声东击西……",
        "Tyrion: 没错……",
        "Tyrion: 这也是比亚特丽丝和厄莉斯失踪的时间。",
        "Tyrion: 考虑到这些事情的发生时间，[p/]比亚特丽丝被操控是在阿斯特被困[i]之后[/i]。",
        "Lucio: ……你要说控制了[i]她[/i]的也是“签约人”？",
        "Tyrion: 不。[p/]我不觉得……",
        "Tyrion: 根据契约内容，[p/]她的意识归属无序女皇，[p/]并不是签约人。",
        "Tyrion: 此外，[p/]也是女皇[i]起草[/i]阿莉亚的血契。",
        "Tyrion: 签约人和女皇显然是同谋关系。",
        "Lucio: ……很好。[p/][i]又多一个[/i]恶魔。",
        "Tyrion: ……先不提这个，[p/]签约人和女皇准备就绪。",
        "Tyrion: 屠杀也在此刻开始。",
        "Tyrion: 签约人控制了阿莉亚的身体。[p/]利用她在下午2:05杀害了冯·桑克图斯。",
        "Tyrion: 根据推测，[p/]阿莉亚此时在公共休息室纵火。",
        "Tyrion: 这里也是冯·桑克图斯尸体的发现场所，[p/]意味着这里就是谋杀现场。",
        "Tyrion: 之后不久，[p/]阿拉里克王子看到冒出的烟，问阿莉亚怎么回事。",
        "Tyrion: 阿莉亚用未知的[b]形变[/b]法术使其无法行动。",
        "Lucio: 这个签约人竟敢利用她攻击王子……",
        "Tyrion: 幸运的是，[p/]法术效果只是暂时的，[p/]阿拉里克没有受伤。",
        "Tyrion: 这之后，[p/]下午2:15，签约人控制阿莉亚杀害希比尔。",
        "Tyrion: 希比尔的尸体被带到西侧阳台，[p/]阿莉亚在这里将尸体投入迦拉克隆湖中。",
        "Tyrion: 议长阿契厄斯目击了这一行为。[p/]但他后来才意识到被从阳台丢下的是什么。",
        "Tyrion: 议长虽然觉得奇怪。[p/]但他还是继续去忙自己的事了。",
        "Tyrion: 他的目的地是祷告室。[p/]但被那里的守卫拒之门外。",
        "Tyrion: 与此同时，[p/]塞莱斯特和我……[p/]正与皮尔斯爵[i]交谈[/i]。",
        "Tyrion: 我们提早出现在了约定地点，[p/]但当时他等的明显是别人。",
        "Tyrion: 我们试图探究怎么回事。[p/]但他拒绝回答问题。",
        "Tyrion: 下午2:20左右，我们听到外面有骚乱。",
        "Tyrion: 塞莱斯特出去调查了。",
        "Tyrion: ……也就是在这时和阿莉亚博斗起来。",
        "Tyrion: 签约人的目标是加里克·皮尔斯，[p/]但塞莱斯特强得他束手无策。",
        "Tyrion: 双方斗了大约15分钟，阿莉亚才终于成功推开她。",
        "Lucio: ……",
        "Tyrion: 二人搏斗期间，[p/]女皇派比亚特丽丝进入祷告室。",
        "Tyrion: 可能也用了隐形法术避人耳目。",
        "Tyrion: 之后女皇利用她施展[b]睡眠术[/b]，让我和皮尔斯失去意识。",
        "Tyrion: 当时我记得自己特意看了一下时间。",
        "Tyrion: 一定是下午2:30没错。",
        "Lucio: ……假设你的证言属实，[p/]比亚特丽丝·弗雷加也是计划里的重要一环。",
        "Tyrion: 对……[p/]考虑到屠杀的迅速程度，[p/]女皇和签约人一定在合作。",
        "Tyrion: 两人应该提前商议好了，怎么利用比亚特丽丝和阿莉亚实施谋杀。",
        "Tyrion: 总之[p/]，比亚特丽丝让我们沉睡之后，[p/]阿莉亚才终于推开塞莱斯特进入祷告室。",
        "Tyrion: 在塞莱斯特追上她之前，[p/]阿莉亚就已经杀掉皮尔斯。",
        "Tyrion: 塞莱斯特进入房间时，阿莉雅和我已经失去意识。",
        "Tyrion: 签约人杀害了三名贵族，实现了目标。",
        "Tyrion: 他们也不再需要操控阿莉亚，这可能是她失去意识的原因。",
        "Tyrion: 阿莉亚和我很快恢复了意识。",
        "Tyrion: 此时裁判所以谋杀罪名逮捕了她。",
        "Lucio: 唔……[p/]皮尔斯爵是受害者之一。",
        "Lucio: 你们的会面比我预想的要重要。",
        "Lucio: 所以卡斯伯特，告诉我。[p/][s/]你们谈论的内容是？",
        "Tyrion: ……",
        "Celeste: ……没关系。[p/]可以告诉他们。",
        "Tyrion: 好吧……[p/]只要你不介意。",
        "Tyrion: ……过去数个月，[p/]塞莱斯特和我都在调查谁是她的亲生父母。",
        "Lucio: 哼……[p/]我记得有不少人抱怨她在勋爵舞会期间的行为。",
        "Tyrion: 理论上，[p/]加里克·皮尔斯握有我们寻找的答案。",
        "Tyrion: 寄给我们的信里说，他想“用这一信息交换自己的自由”。",
        "Tyrion: 我[i]以为[/i]这是他让我当自己的律师。",
        "Lucio: 你觉得我们会信？！",
        "Lucio: 为什么他要找给自己定罪的律师辩护？！",
        "Tyrion: [i]我们[/i]也这么想过。",
        "Tyrion: 到达会面地点时，[p/]皮尔斯找的人明显不是[i]我[/i]。",
        "Tyrion: 收到这封信的本应另有其人。",
        "Rath: ……",
        "Lucio: ……最好别让我发现你在说谎，卡斯伯特。",
        "Tyrion: 不绕弯子，[p/]我不在乎你信不信。",
        "Tyrion: 不提这个，[p/]仔细回顾阿莉亚的行为，[p/]我们可以完善签约人的心理档案。",
        "Lucio: ……这一点确实。",
        "Tyrion: 首先，[p/]辩方希望传唤裁判所指挥官作证。",
        "Tyrion: 他的证言或许能解释冯·桑克图斯与希比尔的死亡之谜。",
        "Tyrion: 尽管目击证词众多，[p/]我们明确知道的也只有[i]皮尔斯[/i]的死法。",
        "Lucio: 对……[p/]他被用自己的血冻成的魔法剑刃刺穿心脏。",
        "这么说有点残酷，[p/]但他和弗林哈特死法一致也是受报应。",
        "虽然这么说也不会让塞莱斯特更好受。",
        "Tyrion: 不管怎样，[p/]我们需要找出杀害这两人的[i]具体[/i]手段。",
        "Tyrion: 屠杀高效迅速。",
        "Tyrion: 事前规划与临场合作必不可少。",
        "Tyrion: 如果能知道谁可能拥有足够情报，[p/]或许就能揪出幕后黑手。",
        "Rath: 我明白了……[p/]听起来是个很好的计划。",
        "Lucio: 国王卫队！[p/][s/]护送指挥官奥蒙·怀特上证人席！",
        "Lucio: 证人。[p/]请向法庭陈述你的姓名与职业。",
        "Orym: 呃、[p/][s/]好……[p/][s/]我……[p/][s/]唔……",
        "Orym: ……",
        "Tyrion: 指挥官？",
        "Orym: 对不起！[p/][s/]我做不到啊！",
        "Orym: 我怎么能若无其事？！",
        "Orym: 我[i]正后方[/i]可站着一只大蜥蜴！",
        "Rath: ……说我是蜥蜴可[i]非常[/i]粗鲁，指挥官。",
        "Orym: 对、[p/][s/]对不起，鳞甲领主……[p/]殿下……",
        "Tyrion: 指挥官……[p/]努力证言发生了什么就好。",
        "Orym: 好、[p/][s/]好的……",
        "Orym: 一切都要从我们收到国王卫队报告时说起。[p/]检察官攻击了阿拉里克王子，公共休息室还着火了。",
        "Orym: 我们不确定斯蒂尔文德那边怎么回事。[p/]就先去公共休息室帮忙灭火。",
        "Orym: 但我们抵达时，[p/]发现一群卫兵昏倒在祷告室前。",
        "Orym: 我们就先去了祷告室。[p/]也在那里发现了皮尔斯的尸体，以及旁边失去意识的斯蒂尔文德和卡斯伯特。",
        "Orym: 之后我们也发现了冯·桑克图斯和希比尔的尸体。[p/]这时我们才意识到三个人都是被她杀害的。",
        "Tyrion: 所以你们还是不知道被操控的斯蒂尔文德怎么杀掉冯·桑克图斯与希比尔的？",
        "Orym: 毫无头绪。",
        "Orym: 冯·桑克图斯的情况更糟。[p/]火几乎烧掉了所有尸体上的线索。",
        "Tyrion: 那希比尔呢？[p/]她身上有没有留下线索？",
        "Orym: 我也不清楚。[p/]她没有遭受外伤。",
        "Orym: 我们只知道她是窒息身亡。",
        "嗯……[p/]调查中肯定还有其他信息。",
        "Orym: 一切都要从我们收到国王卫队报告时说起。[p/]检察官攻击了阿拉里克王子，公共休息室还着火了。",
        "Tyrion: 报告主要基于阿拉里克王子的证言。[p/]没错吧？",
        "Orym: 没错。[p/]我们还是不知道她用的是什么[b]形变[/b]法术。",
        "Tyrion: 根据报告时间来看，[p/]肯定是在三起谋杀过去一段时间以后。",
        "Orym: 对。[p/]这样的结果令人遗憾。",
        "Orym: 如果斯蒂尔文德真的[i]被操控[/i]了，[p/]也是被效率很高的人操控。",
        "问题就是为什么幕后黑手这么高效。",
        "Orym: 我们不确定斯蒂尔文德那边怎么回事。[p/]就先去公共休息室帮忙灭火。",
        "Tyrion: 这么做明智吗？",
        "Tyrion: 不管犯人是谁，[p/]被攻击的可是维文加德王子。",
        "Orym: 被[b]坚牢术[/b]困住的国王已经够让人忙活了。",
        "Orym: 那一小时里发生了[i]太多[/i]。",
        "Orym: 我们的注意力都放在保护皇室安全上。",
        "Lucio: 现在已经能确定攻击国王是为了转移注意。",
        "Lucio: 策划这些的人知道，我们会集中力量保证皇室安全。",

        "Orym: 走廊里到处都是印痕和凹坑。",

        "Tyrion: 为什么不找人帮忙？",
        "Celeste: 因、[p/][s/]因为你醒不过来。[p/]所以我一直在给你传输治愈魔力。",
        "Celeste: 现在想想，[p/]我确实应该找人帮忙。",
        "Celeste: 但即使阿莉亚失去意识了，[p/]当时我也不敢单独把你留在那里……",
        "Tyrion: 呃、[p/][s/]是啊……[p/]抱歉……",
        "回忆当时的事让她很难受。",
        "最好小心一点。",

        "Orym: 皮尔斯已经死了。[p/]你和斯蒂尔文德也没有意识。",
        "Tyrion: 我知道[i]自己[/i]为什么没有意识。[p/]我当时被用了专门催眠别人的法术。",
        "Tyrion: 但阿莉亚怎么也失去了意识？",
        "Orym: 我们也不懂。[p/]恶魔操控的事情我们都是今天才[i]听说[/i]。",
        "Orym: 就我们掌握的情报而言，[p/]那可能是被操控意识一小时以上的后遗症。",
        "这么说有道理。[p/]但这个方向的逻辑真的只是巧合吗？",
        "Orym: 之后我们也发现了冯·桑克图斯和希比尔的尸体。[p/]这时我们才意识到三个人都是被她杀害的。",
        "嗯……[p/]最后一句证词有点含糊。",
        "也许应该让他针对其中一件谋杀案展开说明。",
        "Orym: 斯蒂尔文德肯定是在公共休息室攻击了冯·桑克图斯，使其窒息。",

        "也许应该让他针对其中一件谋杀案展开说明。",
        "Orym: 根据尸体上的烧伤，[p/]他应该先被[b]火焰箭[/b]击中，无法逃走。[p/]他也没有任何自卫手段。",
        "Tyrion: 这样……[p/]她的[b]法术汇编[/b]里[i]的确[/i]包括[b]火焰箭[/b]。",

        "Orym: 攻击肯定使他痛苦异常。",
        "Lucio: ……",
        "Orym: 斯蒂尔文德肯定是在阳台附近攻击了希比尔。[p/]根据尸检报告，[p/]她用某种手段令其窒息。",
        "Tyrion: 因为有人在尸体上用了[b]疗愈术[/b]，[p/]窒息手段不得而知。",
        "Orym: 对……[p/]想搞清楚很麻烦。",
        "你也倾向这个观点。[p/]没人目击这起谋杀。",

        "Orym: 我们之后在迦拉克隆湖里发现了她的尸体。[p/]根据议长的证言，[p/]斯蒂尔文德肯定是从正上方阳台处弃尸。",
        "Tyrion: 你们怎么知道尸体在那里？",
        "Orym: 屠杀开始后，[p/]我们发现哪儿都找不到她。",
        "Orym: 国王卫队成员之一使用了[b]定位生物[/b]，发现她的位置在湖里。",

        "Tyrion: 这些谋杀案里，[p/]皮尔斯的案子情报最多。",
        "Orym: 对。[p/]目前来看，[p/]签约人也没打算放过麦考伊。",
        "Orym: 那场持久战想必打了他们一个措手不及。",
        "Lucio: 我觉得[i]这[/i]有点奇怪……",
        "Tyrion: ……为什么？",
        "Lucio: 我的女儿可当不了士兵。[p/]她一点战斗天赋都没有。",
        "Lucio: 而且我[i]本人[/i]体验过麦考伊的战斗能力。",
        "Lucio: 虽然不愿意承认，[p/]但公平战斗的话，麦考伊应该能轻松碾压我的女儿。",
        "Celeste: 她、[p/]她的魔法很难缠。",
        "Celeste: 我也完全不知道她能用什么法术。[p/]所以必须小心应战。",
        "Celeste: ……虽然发生了这么多，[p/]但我当时[i]真的[/i]不想伤害她。",
        "Lucio: 唔……[p/]太过善良会害死你的，麦考伊。",
        "Tyrion: ……",

        "总之，[p/]要详细问皮尔斯的案子吗？",
        "也许应该让他针对其中一件谋杀案展开说明。",
        "Orym: 她大概没时间采取之前的窒息手段了。[p/]就临机应变，用[b]形变液体[/b]做了一把武器。",

        "Orym: 我们猜她想在致命一击前削弱对手。",

        "Tyrion: 能不能展开讲讲希比尔谋杀案？",
        "Tyrion: 有没有其他能解释她怎样身亡的证据？",

        "Tyrion: 但和冯·桑克图斯不同，[p/]希比尔的尸体没有被烧过。",

        "Orym: 哎，我们在希比尔身上发现了[b]死灵术[/b]的痕迹。",
        "Orym: 我们认为杀掉希比尔后，斯蒂尔文德对尸体使用了[b]疗愈术[/b]。",
        "Orym: 去除了尸体上的所有外伤。",
        "Tyrion: ……和凯瑟琳·贝尔维瑟一模一样。",

        "Tyrion: 杀害弗林哈特·麦考伊时，[p/]皮尔斯用[b]形变液体[/b]是为了防止留下证据。",

        "Lucio: Would you just let me-?!",
        "Theon: I will do as you wish, my Lord!",
        "Theon: It might take some time, though.",
        "Theon: I'll need some time to gather some followers and-.",
        "Rath: Oh my god![p/][s/] We [i]just[/i] want your testimony!",
        "Rath: ...Just tell us what you saw when Ms. Steelwind was at the west-ward balcony yesterday.",
        "Theon: ...O-[p/][s/]Oh, I see.",
        "Theon: If [i]that's[/i] what you truly wish, my Lord.",
        "Tyrion: ...Are we just going to [i]ignore[/i] how ready he was to commit mass murder?",
        "Lucio: Be quiet![p/][s/] We [i]just[/i] got him to calm down!",
        "Theon: I was doing some paperwork in my quarters and I suppose I lost track of the time.[p/] My alarm went off and I realized that it was time for my afternoon prayers.",
        "Theon: I began heading to the Prayer Room when I spotted Lady Steelwind looking over the west-ward balcony.",
        "Theon: I tried to greet her but she didn't respond to me.[p/] That's when I noticed she was pushing something large over the balcony and into Lake Galakrond.",
        "Theon: I asked her what she was doing.[p/] But again,[p/] she ignored me and went towards the Prayer Room.",
        "Theon: I thought nothing of it and made my way there as well.[p/] That's when the guards there turned me away.",
        "Theon: I went back to my quarters to do my Prayers there.",
        "Tyrion: Considering the timing of it all,[p/] this must have all happened minutes before she began attacking the Prayer Room.",
        "Theon: Yes...[p/] I consider myself lucky.[p/] The Scaled Lord must have graced me with divine luck.",
        "Rath: Please.[p/] Just...[p/] stop.",
        "Considering how quickly she was moving,[p/] there [i]has[/i] to be a reason why she waited there.",
        "Was she waiting for the High Speaker to leave?",
        "Perhaps you should closely examine the timing of these events.",
        "Theon: I was doing some paperwork in my quarters and I suppose I lost track of the time.[p/] My alarm went off and I realized that it was time for my afternoon prayers.",
        "Tyrion: An alarm?",
        "Theon: It's a rudimentary artificery device.[p/] I use it to remind me to conduct daily prayers.",
        "Tyrion: ...I see.[p/] And do you have it set to go off at a specific time?",
        "Theon: Yes.[p/] It's set to go off at 2:10 PM: five minutes before my afternoon prayers.",
        "Theon: I was in my quarters when my alarm went off at 2:10 PM.[p/] I realized that it was time for my afternoon prayers.",
        "Tyrion: So you usually say your afternoon prayers at 2:15 PM?",
        "Theon: Yes.[p/] It is said that time is the holiest hour of the God of Dragons: Bahamut.",
        "Rath: ...This is the first [i]I've[/i] heard of this.",
        "Theon: Was I mistaken?!",
        "Theon: Forgive me, my lord![p/] I can't believe I've dishonored your deity!",
        "Rath: Ugh...[p/] You know what?",
        "Rath: Just forget I said anything...",
        "Theon: I began heading to the Prayer Room when I spotted Lady Steelwind looking over the west-ward balcony.",
        "Tyrion: What was her expression like?",
        "Theon: It was very cold and emotionless.",
        "Lucio: ...The Patron must have had control of her when this happened.",
        "Theon: Yes.[p/] That certainly makes the most sense.",
        "Tyrion: Right...[p/]",
        "Tyrion: What time did this happen?",
        "Theon: It was shortly after my alarm went off.[p/] It would definitely be before 2:15 PM.",
        "Theon: I began heading to the Prayer Room when I spotted Lady Steelwind looking over the west-ward balcony.[p/] This happened before 2:15 PM.",
        "Tyrion: So she was looking over Lake Galakrond?",
        "Theon: Knowing what I know now,[p/] it's possible that she was making sure she could throw Lady Sibyl's body [i]into[/i] the lake from there.",
        "Tyrion: But she was clearly fine with [i]you[/i] witnessing her act suspiciously.",
        "Tyrion: Why would she even go to the trouble of hiding Sibyl's body in the first place?",
        "Lucio: The patron clearly needed to delay when the murders were discovered.",
        "Lucio: The defendant wasn't able to murder Pierce until much later, after all.",
        "You suppose that makes sense.[p/] But they probably didn't [i]plan[/i] to fight Celeste for that long.",
        "There [i]has[/i] to be a reason why she threw Sibyl's body into the lake.",
        "Theon: I tried to greet her but she didn't respond to me.[p/] That's when I noticed she was pushing something large over the balcony and into Lake Galakrond.",
        "Tyrion: So she ignored you?[p/] What was her expression like?",
        "Theon: It was very cold and emotionless.",
        "Lucio: ...The Patron must have had control of her when this happened.",
        "Theon: Yes.[p/] That certainly makes the most sense.",
        "Tyrion: What time did this encounter happen?",
        "Theon: It was shortly after my alarm went off.[p/] It was definitely before 2:15 PM.",
        "Theon: It was still before 2:15 PM.[p/] Our encounter was short.[p/] That's when I noticed she was pushing something large over the balcony and into Lake Galakrond.",
        "Tyrion: ...And that must have been Sibyl's body.",
        "Theon: ...I suppose so.",
        "Tyrion: ...You don't sound so sure of it yourself.",
        "Theon: It's just that I recall Lady Sibyl's garb to be much brighter.",
        "Theon: Meanwhile,[p/] the thing I saw Lady Steelwind throw over the balcony was much darker.",
        "Tyrion: Right...[p/] You mentioned that before.",
        "Lucio: It's clear it was just a trick of the sunlight.",
        "Lucio: That balcony is directly above where we found Lady Sibyl's body in Lake Galakrond.",
        "Lucio: You [i]obviously[/i] saw the defendant dumping the body.",
        "Lucio: What [i]else[/i] could it have been?",
        "Theon: Yes...[p/] I suppose you're right.",
        "Theon: I asked her what she was doing.[p/] But again,[p/] she ignored me and went towards the Prayer Room.",
        "Tyrion: The Patron was probably trying to keep her on track.",
        "Tyrion: But I'm surprised she didn't attack you.",
        "Tyrion: Even if the Patron was trying to frame her,[p/] she hadn't killed Pierce yet.",
        "Theon: Yes.[p/] I'm a little confused about that myself.",
        "Theon: But perhaps I should just be happy I came out of that encounter unharmed.",
        "Tyrion: Anyways,[p/] how long did you talk to her?",
        "Theon: Our encounter was very brief since she was ignoring me.",
        "Theon: It couldn't have lasted for more than two minutes.",
        "Theon: I only spent about two minutes trying to speak with her.[p/] But she ignored me and went towards the Prayer Room.[p/]",
        "Tyrion: It must have been a short exchange then.",
        "Lucio: The Patron was controlling her at the time.",
        "Lucio: They must have been hoping that he would leave if she ignored him.",
        "But wouldn't it have been easier to just murder him then and there?",
        "She could have easily done it quickly and thrown his body into the lake.[p/] Just like she did with Sibyl.",
        "Theon: I thought nothing of it and made my way there as well.[p/] That's when the guards there turned me away.",
        "Tyrion: Right...[p/] And these guards are still comatose.",
        "It makes you uneasy that you [i]still[/i] don't have an explanation for that.",
        "Did the Empress of Discord use some kind of demonic magic to do that?",
        "The Eye of Horus doesn't leave magical traces.[p/] So it's possible that demonic magic is the same.",
        "Either way,[p/] it's awfully convenient he left right [i]before[/i] the attack on the Prayer Room happened.",
        "But you suppose you'll have to put a pin in that for now.",
        "Tyrion: Anyways,[p/] what time did this happen?",
        "Theon: I believe it was 2:15 PM.[p/] That's when I usually arrive at the Prayer Room.",
        "Theon: I thought nothing of it and made my way there as well.[p/] That's when the guards there turned me away at 2:15 PM.",
        "Tyrion: Right...[p/] And these guards are still comatose.",
        "It makes you uneasy that you [i]still[/i] don't have an explanation for that.",

        "But you suppose you'll have to put a pin in that for now.",
        "Theon: I went back to my quarters to do my Prayers there.",
        "Tyrion: You were in your quarters during the massacre?",
        "Theon: Yes.[p/] As I've mentioned before,[p/] my room is magically soundproof.",
        "Theon: My guards and I were woefully unaware of what was happening.",
        "Theon: We didn't know what was happening until some members of the Kingsguard came to inform me of what had happened to the King.",
        "So members of the Kingsguard were there with him. And he mentioned that his \"guards\" were there too.",
        "They can all probably verify this.[p/] But it's still a little hard to believe how close he came to harm that day.",
        "Tyrion: Anyways,[p/] how long were you in your quarters for?",
        "Theon: I waited there until the Kingsguard notified me that it was safe.",
        "Theon: I think I waited there until 3:15 PM.",
        "Which was around the time that Aria was arrested.",
        "Theon: I went back to my quarters to do my Prayers there.[p/] I was there until 3:15 PM.",
        "Tyrion: Which means you were in your quarters until the massacre ended.",
        "Tyrion: Did your guards see Steelwind during that time?",
        "Theon: No.[p/] They didn't.",
        "Theon: And all we knew was that His Majesty had been trapped.",
        "Theon: We had no idea Lady Steelwind had been attacking people at that point.",
        "Lucio: It's clear that the High Speaker wasn't one of the Patron's targets.",

        "Lucio: ...What are you talking about?",
        "Lucio: The location from that balcony to where we found Lady Sibyl's body lines up perfectly!",
        "Tyrion: That may be.[p/] But the witness just said he saw Aria dumping the body [i]before[/i] 2:15 PM.",
        "Lucio: ...",
        "Lucio: ...Wait.",
        "Tyrion: You see it too, don't you Lucio?",

        "Rath: I see...[p/] That [i]does[/i] seem peculiar.",

        "Tyrion: From her encounter with Celeste,[p/] it's clear there's a limit to Aria's combat capabilities.",

        "Celeste: ...What?",
        "Tyrion: They knew I wouldn't meet with Pierce alone.[p/] And the information he had was about [i]her[/i].",
        "Tyrion: The Patron correctly guessed that I'd bring her with me.",
        "Tyrion: By killing both Pierce and Celeste,[p/] they'd eliminate any threat Celeste would pose to them.",

        "Lucio: ...My [i]point[/i] is that King Olivier wouldn't abandon a child of pure royal blood.",
        "Lucio: The kingdom requires heirs to continue the royal bloodline.",
        "Lucio: He would've leveraged her in a diplomatic marriage.",
        "Tyrion: ...That's disgusting.",
        "Lucio: That's diplomacy, Cuthbert.",
        "Lucio: Anyways,[p/] even if McCoy was of royal blood,[p/] Aster is the King's eldest child.",
        "Lucio: And he's of [i]pure[/i] royal blood.",
        "Lucio: McCoy would have no claim to the throne under these circumstances.",

        "Lucio: Ah...[p/] If McCoy were to be revealed as a Frega,[p/] his daughters would be legally obligated to share the estate with her.",
        "Celeste: ...Could I seriously be a Frega?",

        "Tyrion: But,[p/] it still doesn't quite fit.[p/] I doubt Laefe or Miriam would do something like this.",
        "Rath: ...What are you basing that on?",
        "Tyrion: I tend to be a good judge of character.[p/] And they just don't seem like the type to do something like this.",
        "Lucio: Bah![p/] You're far too trusting.",
        "Lucio: I hold no doubt that [i]any[/i] of William's children would be capable of something like this.",

        "Celeste: Ugh...[p/] You're barely a father to your [i]actual[/i] daughter.",
        "Tyrion: I'm only stating that possibility for the sake of argument.",
        "Tyrion: As I've said,[p/] it wouldn't make sense for you to frame your own daughter when [i]House Steelwind[/i] would be blamed.",
        "Tyrion: But we need to consider every possibility.",
        "The Eyetaker",
        "Tyrion: ...What if the Eyetaker orchestrated this whole thing?",
        "Lucio: The Eyetaker?[p/] That common criminal?",
        "Lucio: What reason would [i]he[/i] have to do this?",
        "Tyrion: I've heard firsthand that he was planning to expand his influence throughout Wyverngarde.",
        "Tyrion: He was actually plotting with Beatrice to use House Frega to do so.",
        "Tyrion: Since I ruined his original plans,[p/] setting up that massacre might've been his backup plan.",
        "Tyrion: Perhaps we're looking at this all wrong.",
        "Tyrion: What if Celeste was a part of the royal family and they were planning to use her to take the throne?",
        "Lucio: But if he wanted to do so,[p/] why would he put McCoy in danger by having my daughter attack her?",
        "Lucio: Not only that.[p/] He also had the perfect opportunity to murder His Majesty.",
        "Lucio: Imagine if he had placed a more lethal contingent spell in that [b]Glyph of Contingency[/b].",
        "Lucio: His Majesty might have very well died alongside von Sanctus, Sibyl, and Pierce.",
        "Tyrion: Yeah...[p/] I suppose you're right.",
        "Tyrion: But we need to consider every possibility.",
        "Tyrion: Anyways,[p/] we should consider the other suspects first.",
        "Tyrion: Ugh...[p/] But I can't think of anyone else.",
        "Lucio: Yes.[p/] There's a flaw with each suspect.",
        "Lucio: Your logic is clearly flawed.",
        "Well, you don't see [i]him[/i] coming up with any ideas...",
        "Tyrion: ...",

        "Lucio: ...Regardless,[p/] we still have no idea who this \"Empress of Discord\" is.",
        "Lucio: I am loathe to allow such an individual to walk freely through Wyverngarde.",

        "Tyrion: Do you know who this demon is?",
        "Rath: I can't say I do...",
        "Rath: Demons tend to take on many titles over their lifetimes.",
        "Rath: ...But whoever this Empress is,[p/] they are brave to so blatantly encroach on my domain like this.",

        "Tyrion: I can't help but feel that there's something here I'm not seeing.",
        "Tyrion: I just can't put my finger on it.",
        "Rath: We [i]have[/i] been working at this for quite a while.",
        "Rath: Perhaps we should suspend proceedings so that we can look into these new leads.",
        "Lucio: Hmph...[p/] I have no objections.",
        "Lucio: It would give [i]my[/i] men some time to look into what we've discovered today.",
        "Rath: Then it's settled.",
        "Rath: We'll be postponing proceedings for now.",
        "Rath: But you'll all be expected to return here by tomorrow morning.",

        "Tyrion: Using this disguise,[p/] she entered the Grand Cathedral posing as Beatrice Frega's guide.",
        "Tyrion: She then aided the Patron by using Beatrice Frega to help Aria Steelwind massacre members of the nobility.",
        "Lucio: Why are we continuing with this?",
        "Lucio: She's already admitted to taking part in the massacre!",
        "Lucio: Let's force her to tell us who the Patron is and be done with this!",
        "Eris: Ah,[p/] how typical.",
        "Eris: The Grand General thinks he can solve [i]all[/i] of his problems with violence.",
        "Eris: But let me ask you this.[p/] Why are you assuming that the Patron is a human?",
        "Tyrion: ...What?",
        "Eris: In Aria's Contract,[p/] it says that \"the Patron\" is the individual who [i]gives[/i] the Contract to her.",
        "Eris: How do you know that [i]I'm[/i] not that individual?",
        "Eris: I go by many names.[p/] The \"Empress of Discord\" is only one of them.",
        "Lucio: Hmph...[p/] If what you're saying is true,[p/] that makes this a simpler matter.",
        "Lucio: We simply need to execute [i]you[/i] for your crimes against the kingdom.",
        "Eris: Haven't you forgotten what my underling said during Frega's trial?",
        "Eris: As a demon,[p/] I can never truly die.",
        "Eris: If you destroy my body,[p/] I'll simply reform in the Abyssal Hells.",
        "Eris: I wonder...[p/] What might happen to your daughter if you were to draw my ire?",
        "Lucio: ...!",
        "Eris: You're prosecuting her and playing the villain.",
        "Eris: But I know the truth.[p/] You secretly care about her, don't you?",
        "Lucio: ...W-[p/][s/]What nonsense are you spouting?",
        "Eris: When you thought she had Mageblight,[p/] you [i]had[/i] to prosecute her.",
        "Eris: You held onto the little hope that you could convict her and convince her to take a plea deal.",
        "Eris: As the king's wife,[p/] her position [i]might[/i] have been salvageable.",
        "Eris: ...And you did this all so she could be with her [i]beloved[/i] Aster.",
        "Tyrion: ...What?",
        "Lucio: I-[p/][s/]I...",
        "Eris: But then it was revealed she signed a Blood Contract with me.",
        "Eris: [i]That[/i] changed everything.",
        "Eris: Mageblight is one thing.[p/] But a demon owning her soul?",
        "Eris: She can't very well be a queen like this,[p/] now can she?",
        "Eris: You [i]had[/i] to find out who the \"Patron\" was before her trial ended.[p/] Didn't you, Lucio?",
        "Eris: Otherwise,[p/] your beloved daughter would [i]never[/i] be free.",
        "Lucio: ...",
        "Eris: And you did [i]all[/i] of this because you feel [i]bad[/i] for what you did to her.",
        "Lucio: ...[i]Everything[/i] I've done is for the good of House Steelwind.",
        "Eris: Ah,[p/] is [i]that[/i] what you were doing?",
        "Eris: Because the way I see it,[p/] you abandoned her for her entire childhood.",
        "Eris: You felt so guilty about killing her mother,[p/] that you couldn't [i]bear[/i] to face her.",
        "Lucio: N-[p/][s/]No...[p/][s/] I-",
        "Tyrion: ...Eris.[p/] Stop this.",
        "Eris: And you [i]know[/i] what that did to her.",
        "Eris: You didn't [i]just[/i] take away her mother.[p/] You took away her father too.",
        "Eris: You starved her of any affection.",
        "Eris: She couldn't help but latch onto the [i]first[/i] person to show her any kind of superficial kindness.",
        "Tyrion: Eris!",
        "Eris: She didn't fall in love with Aster.[p/] She became [i]obsessed[/i] with him.",
        "Eris: She stopped being her own person.[p/] And she clings to him like a parasite.",
        "Eris: She changed [i]everything[/i] about herself to suit his likes and desires.",
        "Eris: And you know deep down in your heart...[p/] You know that if he is [i]ever[/i] taken away from her,[p/] she [i]will[/i] fall apart.",
        "Lucio: ...",
        "Eris: Since I pity you so much,[p/] I'll let you in on a little secret.",
        "Eris: Killing me won't save your daughter.[p/] And you [i]don't[/i] have the means to confine me.",
        "Eris: And even if you know who I am,[p/] your daughter will [i]never[/i] be safe from my influence.",
        "Lucio: ...What?",
        "Eris: But I suppose there's [i]one[/i] possible way to break my Contract.",
        "Lucio: W-[p/][s/]What?![p/][s/] What is it?!",
        "Eris: My Contract \"will bind Aria Steelwind to the Patron so long as they [i]both[/i] live.”",
        "Eris: If you truly want to free your daughter from my control,[p/] all you have to do is [i]kill[/i] her.",
        "Eris: Do the poor thing a favor and put her out of her misery.",

        "Lucio: ...",
        "Is she right...?[p/] Is Aria's fate truly doomed?",
        "There has to be [i]something[/i] you can do.",
        "Tyrion: ...I just don't understand, Eris.",
        "Tyrion: Why are you doing this?",
        "Tyrion: You're not a noble...[p/] You're probably not even a citizen of Wyverngarde.",
        "Tyrion: Why would you go through the trouble of doing [i]any[/i] of this?!",
        "Eris: ...Tyrion.[p/] Why are [i]you[/i] here?",
        "Tyrion: ...What?",
        "Eris: Why do you constantly risk your life for the sake of others?",
        "Eris: Why do you try to seek justice in a [i]clearly[/i] unjust world?",
        "Tyrion: ...I don't know, honestly.",
        "Eris: I think you [i]do[/i] know.",
        "Eris: The answer is simple.[p/] You do it because it satisfies you.",
        "Eris: You save people.[p/] You \"fight\" the system.",
        "Eris: You just love indulging in your own heroics, don't you?",
        "Celeste: That's not-!",
        "Eris: It feels good, doesn't it Tyrion?",
        "Eris: You know that you're the only righteous person in an unjust society.",
        "Eris: When you succeed,[p/] you're hailed as a hero.",
        "Eris: And if you fail,[p/] it's society's fault,[p/] not yours.",
        "Eris: No matter what happens,[p/] you can take solace in the knowledge that you're so much [i]better[/i] than everyone else.",
        "Eris: That superiority you feel over them must be intoxicating.",
        "Eris: Your divine blood makes it so.[p/] You just can't resist giving in to it.",
        "Tyrion: ...",
        "Eris: But just as your divine blood compels you to do good,[p/] [i]my[/i] hellish blood compels me to do the opposite.",
        "Eris: I just can't [i]help[/i] but take every opportunity to make you all suffer.",
        "Eris: My entire [i]purpose[/i] is to see each and every one of their faces contorted in agony and despair.",
        "Eris: ...Humanity is a stain on the world.",
        "Eris: They're worthless parasites who steal,[p/] maim,[p/] and kill to get what they want.",
        "Eris: That's all they are.[p/] And I [i]despise[/i] those who try to pretend that they're [i]anything[/i] different.",
        "Tyrion: ...",
        "Tyrion: You're wrong, Eris.[p/] Humanity is so much more than you realize.",
        "Tyrion: ...And I truly pity you if that's all you see in us.",
        "Eris: Oh,[p/] so now it's \"us\".",
        "Eris: That actually just reminded me,[p/] there's something I hate even more than humanity...",
        "Eris: I [i]despise[/i] the celestials of the Upper Planes who go against the natural order.",
        "Eris: They condemn and admonish beings like me,[p/] all while watching humanity suffer from their secluded little heaven.",
        "Eris: They realized that humanity would never [i]willingly[/i] choose good over evil.",
        "Eris: So they created the heavensborn to tip the balance in their favor.",
        "Eris: It's so self-indulgent that it makes me want to puke.",
        "Tyrion: ...[i]That's[/i] what the heavensborn are?",
        "Eris: It is.[p/] And I've made quite a hobby out of breaking them and sending them back to their creators.",
        "Eris: I throw them into the deepest pit of despair before extinguishing their lives.",
        "Eris: There's been no greater joy in my eternal life.",
        "Eris: ...And it took a lot of work to get [i]you[/i] right where I need you, Tyrion.",
        "Tyrion: Wait...[p/] Are you saying-?",
        "Eris: You asked me why I did this, didn't you?",
        "Eris: My actions that day were all for you, my dearest Tyrion.",
        "Eris: All so I could see the despair on your face when you realized the [i]truth[/i].",
        "Celeste: Tyrion...",
        "Tyrion: N-[p/][s/]No...",
        "Lucio: That's enough out of you, you witch.",

        "Lucio: Cuthbert![p/][s/] You [i]promised[/i] me that we would save my daughter together!",
        "Tyrion: I-[p/][s/]I'm sorry...[p/] I-",
        "Lucio: You said those words to me with such conviction.",
        "Lucio: Yet here you stand...[p/] quivering like a grunt in his first battle.",
        "Tyrion: ...",
        "Lucio: Are a few meager doubts enough to force a retreat from you?",
        "Lucio: Is [i]that[/i] all it takes to defeat the infamous Tyrion Cuthbert?",
        "Tyrion: ...",
        "...He's probably desperate at this point.",
        "If Eris is the Patron,[p/] there's very little hope for Aria.",
        "Unlike Beatrice's,[p/] her Blood Contract was short and concise.",
        "There was very little room for interpretation.[p/] So you probably can't dispute it either.",
        "But what kind of attorney would you be-...",
        "No...[p/][s/] What kind of [i]friend[/i] would you be if you didn't see this through?",
        "Tyrion: ...Eris.[p/] We didn't call you here today to wax poetic with you.",
        "Tyrion: The people you've harmed have a right to know what you did that day.",
        "Tyrion: So either give us your testimony or [i]get out[/i].",
        "Eris: Even now,[p/] you're still undeterred.[p/] I really [i]do[/i] love that about you.",
        "Eris: ...But I do wonder how long that will last.",
        "Eris: It's true.[p/] I was the one who masterminded this.",
        "Eris: I knew about the King's funeral at the Grand Cathedral.[p/] So I forced Beatrice Frega to allow me to accompany her.",
        "Eris: When I was there,[p/] I used my Contracts with Beatrice Frega and Aria Steelwind to compel them to act against their will.",
        "Eris: And through the actions of Beatrice Frega and Aria Steelwind,[p/] I facilitated the deaths of Lloyd von Sanctus,[p/] Coraline Sibyl,[p/] and Garrick Pierce.",
        "Eris: The only motivation for my actions that day was to harm Tyrion Cuthbert's friends and make him suffer.",
        "Eris: And before you ask...[p/] Aside from my thralls,[p/] I was acting alone that day.[p/] I didn't follow direct [i]or[/i] indirect orders from anyone.",
        "Tyrion: Your testimony is pretty...[p/] thorough.",
        "Eris: Of course.[p/] I [i]am[/i] a demon after all.",
        "Eris: Since I'm unable to lie,[p/] I thought it would be best to be as detailed as possible.",
        "Eris: That way,[p/] there's no room for doubt.",
        "Eris: Isn't that wonderful, Tyrion?",
        "Ugh...[p/] She's definitely playing with you.",
        "She may not have [i]technically[/i] lied.[p/] But she's definitely not acting in good faith.",
        "You should look at her testimony more closely.",
        "Eris: It's true.[p/] I was the one who masterminded this.",
        "Tyrion: So you completely carried out this plan yourself.",
        "Eris: Well,[p/] I clearly had the help of Beatrice Frega and Aria Steelwind.",
        "Eris: So I wasn't [i]truly[/i] acting alone.",
        "Tyrion: You know what I meant.",
        "Eris: Yes, yes.[p/] I just can't help myself sometimes.",
        "Eris: To state things plainly,[p/] no human [i]willingly[/i] helped me with my plan that day.",
        "You know that she [i]can't[/i] lie.",
        "But she's probably had a lot of practice deceiving people.",
        "You should keep your wits about you.",
        "Eris: I knew about the King's funeral at the Grand Cathedral.[p/] So I forced Beatrice Frega to allow me to accompany her.",
        "Tyrion: ...How [i]did[/i] you find out about it?[p/] It was supposed to be a closely guarded secret.",
        "Eris: Oh, Tyrion.[p/] I can't tell you [i]all[/i] of my secrets.[p/] Now can I?",
        "Tyrion: ...",
        "You can't exactly threaten to charge her with perjury...",
        "It's a surprise that she's even testifying in the first place.",
        "Until you can extract all of the information she has,[p/] you'll just have to play along with her games.",
        "Eris: When I was there,[p/] I used my Contracts with Beatrice Frega and Aria Steelwind to compel them to act against their will.",
        "Tyrion: What a terrifying ability...",
        "Eris: Thank you for noticing.",
        "Tyrion: That...[p/] wasn't a compliment.",
        "Tyrion: ...I find it all quite sickening how you demons prey on people.",
        "Eris: \"Prey\"?",
        "Eris: People know what they're signing up for when they sign a Contract with a demon.",
        "Eris: You can hardly blame [i]me[/i] for collecting what was freely offered.",
        "Tyrion: Please.[p/] We [i]both[/i] know that Aria didn't knowingly or willingly sign that Contract.",
        "Eris: ...Aren't you just assuming that?",
        "Tyrion: ...What?",
        "Eris: How do you know that she [i]didn't[/i] knowingly sign a Contract with me?",
        "Tyrion: My client would never [i]willingly[/i] sign a Contract with you, Eris.",
        "Eris: Really?[p/] What if I were to threaten her dearest fiancé?",
        "Lucio: ...",
        "Eris: You may see Aria as a paragon of justice.",
        "Eris: But everyone has their breaking point.",
        "Tyrion: If that's true,[p/] tell us under what circumstances Aria signed the Contract.",
        "Eris: ...",
        "You knew it.[p/] She's just trying to get inside your head.",
        "Aria would've never signed a Contract like that,[p/] even if it were to protect Aster.",
        "Eris: Through the actions of Beatrice Frega and Aria Steelwind,[p/] I facilitated the deaths of Lloyd von Sanctus,[p/] Coraline Sibyl,[p/] and Garrick Pierce.",
        "Tyrion: Why are you using their full names?",
        "Eris: You know I can't lie.[p/] So I thought I'd give you [i]something[/i].",
        "Eris: For example,[p/] I could have easily referred to [i]another[/i] Steelwind or another Frega that I enthralled.",
        "Eris: That list is [i]very[/i] long, you know.",
        "Lucio: ...",
        "Tyrion: Ignore her, Lucio.[p/] She's trying to get under your skin.",
        "Tyrion: Anyways...[p/] Aside from Pierce,[p/] von Sanctus and Sibyl were key members of the Wyverngarde nobility.",
        "Tyrion: What reason could you possibly have to kill the three of them?",
        "Eris: Hm...[p/] I didn't.",
        "Tyrion: ...What?",
        "Eris: I didn't have a reason to kill them.[p/] I just [i]happened[/i] to facilitate their deaths.",
        "Tyrion: N-[p/][s/]No...[p/] But...",
        "Tyrion: You [i]specifically[/i] went after them.",
        "Eris: I [i]did[/i].[p/] But I didn't have any particular reason to do so.",
        "Tyrion: But that doesn't make any sense!",
        "Eris: I suppose it doesn't.",
        "Eris: Anyways,[p/] would you like for me to add that to my testimony?",
        "Tyrion: ...What?!",
        "Eris: It would help you, wouldn't it?",
        "Tyrion: I...[p/] Yeah...[p/] I suppose so.",
        "She has [i]got[/i] to be the most unpredictable witness you've cross-examined.",
        "Eris: I didn't really have a reason to kill [i]them[/i] specifically.[p/] I just needed Aria to kill my victims as quickly and efficiently as possible.",
        "Tyrion: We already established that Pierce was killed due to his knowledge of Celeste's parentage.",
        "Tyrion: How could you possibly have no motivation to see them dead?!",
        "Eris: ...Aren't you just assuming that?",
        "Tyrion: I'm [i]not[/i]![p/][s/] That's the only logical conclusion!",
        "Eris: And that's where you made your mistake.",
        "Eris: You're assuming that I act logically.",
        "Tyrion: ...",
        "You're a bit out of your element right now...",
        "Every murder you've investigated has always followed [i]some[/i] kind of logic that you could use to make deductions.",
        "But Eris is a different beast, entirely.",
        "For all you know,[p/] she could be completely insane.",
        "You might very well be seeing connections that aren't there.",
        "Eris: My only motivation for my actions that day was to harm Tyrion Cuthbert's friends and make him suffer.",
        "Tyrion: ...",
        "Eris: Is something wrong, Tyrion?",
        "Eris: I went to all this trouble to get your attention.[p/] The least you could do is appreciate it.",
        "Lucio: Enough![p/] Stay on subject, witness.",
        "Tyrion: ...I'm not complaining about this.[p/]",
        "Tyrion: But if you really wanted to make me suffer,[p/] why wouldn't you just go after the people close to me?",
        "Eris: Oh...[p/] But what would be the fun in that?",
        "Eris: Killing people is such an [i]easy[/i] task to accomplish.[p/] Even a [i]child[/i] can do it.",
        "Eris: There are much more [i]effective[/i] ways to make someone suffer.",
        "Tyrion: ...",
        "Eris: And before you ask...[p/] Aside from my thralls,[p/] I was acting alone that day.[p/] I didn't follow direct [i]or[/i] indirect orders from anyone.",
        "Tyrion: ...Why do you find the need to specify that?",
        "Eris: To leave less room for doubt.",
        "Eris: Beatrice used an indirect order to feign innocence in your previous trial, didn't she?",
        "Tyrion: But [i]did[/i] you work together with anyone to facilitate the massacre?",
        "Eris: Of course, I did.",
        "Eris: I worked together with Beatrice Frega and Aria Steelwind.",
        "Tyrion: Ugh...[p/] You [i]know[/i] what I meant, Eris.",
        "Eris: My apologies.[p/] I just can't help myself sometimes.",

        "Eris: I did not have a Contract with anyone that wanted to facilitate any of those murders.",

        "Did she set all of this up so you would have a mystery to solve...?",

        "Celeste: We went to the Prayer Room a lot earlier for our meeting,[p/] and that commotion we heard was actually Beatrice and Eris attacking the guards at 1:40 PM.",
        "Celeste: They tricked me and slipped into the Prayer Room...[p/] After that,[p/] Beatrice...[p/] killed you.",
        "Celeste: I didn't know what to do.[p/] That's when Eris told me she would resurrect you in exchange for killing Pierce.",
        "Celeste: I know I shouldn't have done it.[p/] But I just wanted you back...[p/] I didn't care about what happened to me.",
        "Celeste: I didn't realize that she'd use \"my eternal servitude\" to take control of my body.[p/] She used me to trick Aria into signing [i]another[/i] Blood Contract.",

        "Tyrion: Does that mean you never even fought her?",
        "Celeste: I'm sorry for lying...[p/] But I had to create an alibi.",

        "Celeste: They acted like someone [i]else[/i] had killed them.",

        "Celeste: I think she used [b]Necrotic Blight[/b].",
        "Tyrion: So [i]that's[/i] why Lord Asclepius said that I had traces of [b]necromancy[/b] on me.",

        "Celeste: Anyways,[p/] Eris offered her deal to me.[p/] But I couldn't go through with killing Pierce...[p/] I think you know the rest.",
        "Celeste: A few minutes after Pierce died,[p/] Aster,[p/] the Inquisition,[p/] and the Kingsguard showed up to arrest Aria.",
        "Lucio: Aside from your conversation with Illmater...[p/] That seems to match up with what we already knew.",
        "Rath: Hm...[p/] It appears we'll simply need to wait for Celeste's memories to return.",

        "Celeste: I think I remember now.[p/] We went to meet with Pierce at 1:50 PM.[p/] And we heard that commotion outside at 2:20 PM.",
        "Tyrion: Right...[p/] We now know for certain that the meeting [i]was[/i] at 2:00 PM.",
        "Celeste: Yeah...[p/] She only changed my memories so she could trick all of us.",
        "Tyrion: Considering that [i]my[/i] memories were intact,[p/] she must have not had the power to change them.",
        "Lucio: Yes...[p/] She never actually used her demonic powers to revive you.",
        "Lucio: She merely had Beatrice release the [b]Feign Death[/b] spell that [i]she[/i] originally cast.",
        "Celeste: ...I still can't believe I fell for that.",
        "Tyrion: Anyways...[p/] Who did you see attacking the guards?[p/] Was it Aria or Beatrice?",
        "Celeste: I saw Aria attacking the guards there.[p/] And I fought her for about fifteen minutes before she broke past me.",
        "Tyrion: Originally,[p/] you said that you fought her for a [i]lot[/i] longer.",
        "Celeste: Yeah.[p/] I had to account for the time I spent speaking to Eris.",
        "Lucio: I had a [i]feeling[/i] something was off about that.",
        "Celeste: I knew Tyrion would be really meticulous about the timeline of the murder.",
        "Celeste: So I had to make my testimony match up with the time of Pierce's death.",
        "Tyrion: ...",
        "Celeste: ...I'm [i]really[/i] sorry.",
        "Tyrion: ...We'll talk about this later.",

        "Celeste: When I followed her into the Prayer Room,[p/] I found her there with Beatrice and Eris.[p/] They knocked Aria,[p/] Tyrion,[p/] and Pierce unconscious.",
        "Tyrion: So we [i]weren't[/i] wrong about Beatrice sneaking past you during your fight.",
        "Celeste: Yeah...[p/] Now that I look back on it,[p/] it was probably a distraction so Beatrice could sneak past me.",
        "Tyrion: Hm...",
        "Lucio: What is it, Cuthbert?",
        "Tyrion: If the Patron was working [i]together[/i] with Eris,[p/] why would Eris use Beatrice to knock out Aria?",
        "Celeste: I never thought of that...",
        "Lucio: ...Frankly,[p/] I find it hard to believe that the Patron willingly went along with the Empress's convoluted plan.",
        "Lucio: They clearly [i]needed[/i] Pierce to die.[p/] And relying on McCoy to do it seems foolhardy.",
        "Right...[p/] Is it possible that Eris went off-script then?",

        "Maybe you’ve been thinking about this the wrong way.",

        "Tyrion: No...[p/] Aria may be extremely lovesick around him,[p/] but she's still an attorney.",
        "Tyrion: She would be careful to read [i]any[/i] contract she signed.",
        "Tyrion: We deduced earlier that her Blood Contract was disguised as a normal legal document.",

        "Tyrion: ...The Patron controlled Aria and committed each of the murders without having to do [i]anything[/i] personally.",

        "Tyrion: I recall that you went to a meeting with the High Speaker right [i]before[/i] the massacre started.",
        "Tyrion: It was to discuss your marriage to Aria, wasn't it?",
        "Aster: ...Yes.[p/] That's correct.",
        "Tyrion: Aster,[p/] the Blood Contract that Aria signed needed to [i]look[/i] like a normal legal document.",

        "Tyrion: I have more than just speculation, Your Grace.",
        "Tyrion: ...I have a copy of it.",

        "Aster: ...S-[p/][s/]She-![p/][s/] Why would she-?!",
        "Tyrion: The moment she regained consciousness,[p/] she thought she was a danger to others.",
        "Tyrion: She had [i]no[/i] memories of what she did that day,[p/] but she knew something was wrong.",
        "Tyrion: That's why she locked herself in a cell with an [b]Anti-Magic Field[/b].",
        "Tyrion: She was being [i]rightfully[/i] cautious.",

        "Aster: I wonder just how [i]bloody[/i] of a civil war that would plunge this nation into.",
        "Aster: And even [i]if[/i] Lucio doesn't have much difficulty crushing the commoners...",
        "Aster: I am sure you can imagine just how tempting a weakened Wyverngarde would look to the other nations.",
        "Damn it![p/][s/] By killing Sibyl and von Sanctus,[p/] he left a power vacuum that only [i]he[/i] could fill.",
        "Tyrion: Aster![p/][s/] You're holding the [i]entire[/i] kingdom hostage!",
        "Aster: I am merely consolidating power where it belongs.",
        "Aster: In the hands of a kind and [i]benevolent[/i] ruler,[p/] who is finally going to [i]fix[/i] this nation.",
        "Tyrion: You [i]murdered[/i] several people,[p/][s/] consorted with demons,[p/][s/] and [i]enslaved[/i] your own fiancée!",
        "Aster: I'm sure that to [i]you[/i],[p/] my actions may seem evil and unforgivable.",
        "Aster: But to those in the Wyverngarde nobility,[p/] I doubt that I’m even the first to do such a thing.",
        "Aster: This is just...[p/] politics.",
        "Aster: And I think [i]that[/i] makes Checkmate, Cuthbert.",
        "Tyrion: ...",
        "Aster: I can't believe it.[p/] I've always [i]wanted[/i] to say that.",
        "Celeste: What are you all doing?!",
        "Celeste: Are you just going to let him get away?!",
        "Rath: ...",
        "Lucio: ...",
        "Celeste: Lucio![p/][s/] She's your [i]daughter[/i]!",
        "Celeste: Are you just going to let him keep control over her?!",
        "Lucio: ...My daughter would not sacrifice the stability of Wyverngarde for her freedom.",
        "Lucio: You know that to be true...",
        "Celeste: That's-!",
        "Celeste: He killed so many people [i]and[/i] he enslaved Aria...",
        "Celeste: He almost killed you and he [i]tried[/i] to kill me...",
        "Wait a minute...[p/][s/] That's right!",
        "Tyrion: Why [i]did[/i] he try to kill you?",
        "Celeste: ...What do you mean?",
        "Tyrion: If Aster is the Patron,[p/] that means that Pierce [i]originally[/i] sent that letter to [i]him[/i].",
        "Tyrion: ...King de Wyverngarde just recently died.",
        "Tyrion: If Aster thought she was a threat,[p/] could that mean that Celeste has royal blood?",
        "Lucio: That wouldn't make much sense.",
        "Lucio: Even if McCoy was of royal blood,[p/] Aster is the King's eldest child and he's of [i]pure[/i] royal blood.",
        "Lucio: McCoy would have no claim to the throne under these circumstances.",
        "Tyrion: If you [i]were[/i] his half-sister,[p/] you wouldn't have a claim to the throne.",
        "Tyrion: So why would he go to so much trouble to kill Pierce [i]and[/i] you?",
        "Celeste: ...Maybe he just wanted to make sure?",
        "Tyrion: But he wouldn't have had Eris kill Pierce personally if it wasn't important...",
        "Tyrion: He needed both you [i]and[/i] Pierce to die during the massacre.",
        "Tyrion: Which means you two were [i]just[/i] as important targets as von Sanctus and Sibyl.",
        "Celeste: Okay...?[p/] But my potential claim to the throne would be the only reason why he'd be scared of me.",
        "Celeste: If [i]that[/i] wasn't a problem,[p/] why would he be so scared of Pierce's blackmail?",
        "Would the line of succession be the [i]only[/i] reason why he'd be scared of Celeste's parentage?",
        "Recall what you remember about Wyverngarde's laws regarding the royal throne.",

        "The Church of Bahamut",
        "You recall a conversation you had with Theon Archeus.",
        "Theon: The Church of Bahamut is important not only to Wyverngarde's culture but to its civil stability.",
        "Theon: Faith is a powerful and unifying force.",
        "Tyrion: ...Is that why you revise Wyverngarde's history and keep heavensborn outside the country?",
        "Theon: I don't know [i]what[/i] you're trying to insinuate. [mind=\"Hmph... Dissidents like him will be the end of our culture.\"/]",
        "Aster didn't murder the High Speaker when he had the chance.",
        "So it's possible that the Church of Bahamut plays a role in his future plans.",
        "But that wouldn't explain why he needed Pierce to die.",
        "The Theocracy of Lumina",
        "You recall a conversation you had with Beatrice Frega.",
        "Beatrice: It's probably because of Wyverngarde's bloody history with the Theocracy of Lumina.",
        "Tyrion: The theocracy?[p/] Aren't they the nation east of us?",
        "Beatrice: Yes.[p/] The luminites worship the celestial gods,[p/] while [i]our[/i] people worship the ancient dragons.",
        "Beatrice: A few centuries ago,[p/] our nation was locked in a bitter war with the luminites.",
        "Beatrice: Even now,[p/] the crown sees the celestial religions as a threat to our draconic culture.",
        "Beatrice: The church has done its best to wipe out any religions that worship the Celestials.",
        "Hm...[p/] If Aster's actions had anything to do with the Theocracy,[p/] he would've targeted you,[p/] not Celeste.",
        "And that also wouldn't explain why he needed Pierce to die.",
        "The Scaled Lord",

        "ERIS: As the savior of our kingdom,[p/] he and his kin were given an honorary position on our political hierarchy.",
        "ERIS: The ancient dragons' authority technically rivals that of the king.",
        "TYRION: Wow…[p/] I had no idea.",
        "TYRION: How have I never heard of this before?",
        "ERIS: To be honest,[p/] that law is just a way to revere him and appease the church.",
        "Wait...[p/] The Scaled Lord [i]and[/i] his kin can override the King's rule...?",

        "Celeste: Isn't making a pact with a demon just [i]asking[/i] for trouble?",
        "Celeste: They'd definitely betray you the first chance they got.",
        "Harold: Well, legends say that demons often drafted Blood Contracts for this reason.",
        "Tyrion: Wait...[p/] Do you mean like a [i]legally binding[/i] contract?",
        "Harold: The concept is similar.[p/] But once you sign a Blood Contract,[p/] both you and the demon are magically compelled to fulfill its terms.",
        "Harold: It's said that violating its terms will result in instant death for the offender...[p/] No matter who it is.",
        "Tyrion: So I guess there's [i]some[/i] protection...",
        "Harold: Well...[p/] As an attorney,[p/] I'm sure you understand that it's possible to exploit and use loopholes in [i]any[/i] contract.",
        "Harold: And according to the legends,[p/] demons take great pride in their ability to deceive and corrupt people.",
        "Hm...[p/] Aster [i]did[/i] make a deal with the Empress of Discord.",
        "But they never actually made it official with a Blood Contract.",
        "They were probably using each other to accomplish their goals.",

        "Coraline: We handle the kingdom's legislative and judicial branches.",
        "Tyrion: ...That would also mean you're responsible for our kingdom's justice system.",
        "Coraline: That is correct.",
        "Hm...[p/] With three of the Four Pillar House leaders dead,[p/] very few people will be able to challenge Aster.",
        "And since Aria was framed for it,[p/] House Steelwind will probably lose its influence as well.",
        "Aster probably did all this to weaken the nobility's ability to challenge his rule.",

        "Celeste: You're looking up at the sky.[p/] Are you looking at the stars?",
        "Aria: I was looking at the moon.[p/] It's full tonight.",
        "Celeste: ...Do you mind if I watch it with you?",
        "Aria: ...",
        "Aria: Do what you want.[p/] I technically take orders from you now.",
        "Celeste: ...You know.[p/] It was also a full moon outside on the night my parents found me in their inn.",
        "Celeste: That's why they named me \"Celeste\".[p/] It's the word for \"heavenly bodies\" in the draconic language.",
        "Aria: ...Is that so?",
        "Celeste: Yeah...[p/] They told me they thought I was a gift from the Scaled Lord.",
        "Celeste: In a roundabout way,[p/] they were actually kind of right.",
        "Celeste: It's a little funny when you think about it.",
        "Celeste: ...By the way,[p/] I never got to thank you for sticking up for me before.",
        "Aria: ...What?",
        "Celeste: Remember?[p/] You [i]jumped[/i] onto the stand when Tyrion manifested my Blood Contract.",
        "Celeste: Not that I blame him,[p/] but I don't think even [i]he[/i] believed in me at that point.",
        "Celeste: If you'd never done that,[p/] who [i]knows[/i] how this could have ended up?",

        "Celeste: You're...[p/] not [i]really[/i] going to charge me with perjury, are you?",
        "Aria: Of course I am.[p/] I was serious about that.",
        "Celeste: Damn it...",
        "Aria: But we [i]do[/i] require your help to hold the structure of our kingdom together.",
        "Aria: We won't sentence you to prison,[p/] but I might have you do some community service.",

        "Aria: I am![p/][s/] I'm a complete and utter fool!",
        "Aria: I [i]knew[/i] about Blood Contracts after what happened to Beatrice!",

        "Celeste: That's not fair.",
        "Celeste: No [i]one[/i] could have expected him to do something like that.",
        "Aria: Now my father...[p/] h-[p/][s/]he's going to pay for my [i]stupid[/i] mistakes!",
        "Celeste: ...I'm sorry.",
        "Aria: Celeste.[p/] Why did I trust him so much?",

        "Celeste: Tyrion,[p/] your father,[p/] we're all here for you.",

        "Celeste: Wait...[p/] Are we still on that?",
        "Remus: Mr. Cuthbert,[p/] I've spoken with my associates in the press.",
        "Remus: The story we created should be printed as we speak.",
        "Celeste: ...I don't like this.",
        "Celeste: We're lying to the people of Wyverngarde about what [i]really[/i] happened.",
        "Celeste: Not to mention,[p/] this story paints me like I'm some kind of god.",
        "Tyrion: I understand your reservations,[p/] but Aster [i]was[/i] right about how the commonfolk felt about him.",
        "Tyrion: If we told the people what [i]actually[/i] happened-",
        "Aria: They would never believe it.",
        "Aria: They'd think that his death was a part of some sort of political conspiracy.",
        "Aria: And even [i]with[/i] this cover story,[p/] we can't be certain that they [i]still[/i] won't suspect that.",
        "Tyrion: A-[p/][s/]Aria?!",
        "Celeste: Shouldn't you be resting?!",
        "Aria: Nonsense,[p/] I'm not going to sit around feeling sorry for myself while everyone else fixes my mistakes.",
        "Tyrion: ...!",
        "She may be hiding her pain behind a smile,[p/] but she's not shutting down her emotions like before.",

        "Aria: As much as it pains me,[p/] we should strive to carry forth the virtues that His-...[p/] that [i]Aster[/i] represented to the commonfolk.",
        "Aria: Wyverngarde will gain more from those false virtues than from the person that he truly was.",
        "Aria: The stability of our nation must be maintained if we're to move forward,[p/] and if we must use the people's piety to do that,[p/] then so be it.",
        "Celeste: Aria...",
        "Aria: And as the newly appointed head of House Steelwind,[p/] I will also do my part to support your rule.",
        "Remus: As will the Scaled Lord.",
        "Celeste smiles in gratitude to their words,[p/] but she meekly glances at you expectantly.",

        "Tyrion: ...I'll need to apologize to her about that.",

        "Celeste: Tyrion,[p/] the last time you saw her,[p/] you manifested a Blood Contract without explaining anything.",
        "Celeste: [i]Then[/i] you vaguely said something about helping Aria.",
