        "Liafal: Even so...[p/] She's not the type of person to trust her accomplice to stay quiet.",
        "Liafal: She'd find a way to carry out a plan herself.[p/] And she'd only employ someone else's help if she had full control of them.",

        "Ruby: Cuthbert.[p/] You're [i]not[/i] a prosecutor.[p/] You know that, right?",
        "Ruby: Didn't you become an attorney to [i]defend[/i] persecuted mages?",
        "Tyrion: B-[p/][s/]But Beatrice [i]is[/i] guilty.[p/] I [i]saw[/i] it!",
        "Ruby: I'm not going to argue about this again.",
        "Ruby: You are [i]going[/i] to withdraw.[p/] This is not up for discussion.",
        "You've always regarded and respected Ms. Tymora.[p/] And you suppose that's always made you deeply scared of disappointing her.",
        "Perhaps she's right...[p/] She knows more about what's going on than you do.[p/] And she's still your mentor.",
        "...",
        "You [i]want[/i] to believe that.[p/] You really do.",
        "But deep down,[p/] you know that this is wrong.",
        "Ms. Tymora may believe in Beatrice's innocence.[p/] But you can't just abandon this case and let her escape justice.",
        "Tyrion: <line-height=1.6em>我、[p/][s/]我……",
        "Your hands are trembling.[p/] Why are you so scared right now?",
        "You know what you have to say but the words won't leave your mouth.",
        "Celeste: <line-height=1.6em>……",
        "From behind you,[p/] you feel Celeste hold your trembling hand.",
        "It's warm and comforting...[p/] It's that same sensation you felt back then.",
        "Somehow you can feel it through her hand.[p/] It's as if she's silently telling you that you know what you have to do.",
        "Your anxiety fades and you take a deep breath.",
        "Tyrion: ...I'm not going to do that, Ms. Tymora.",
        "Ruby: ...What?",
        "Tyrion: You said it yourself.[p/] Our court system needs a defense attorney and a prosecutor of equal power to keep things fair.",
        "Ruby: T-[p/][s/]That's not what I-!",
        "Tyrion: I'm not going to withdraw.[p/] If you believe in Beatrice's innocence,[p/] and if you truly believe you're on the right side...",
        "Tyrion: ...Then prove it by beating me.",
        "Ruby: <line-height=1.6em>……",
        "Ruby: ...Fine.[p/] Do what you want.[p/] But you're only going to make things harder for everyone.",
        "Celeste: ...Tyrion?!",
        "As soon as Ms. Tymora steps out of the room,[p/] your body drops to the floor.",
        "Whatever bravery you felt before got replaced with an extreme amount of fatigue.",
        "Tyrion: Scaled Lord...[p/] That's the first time I've ever spoken to her like that.",
        "Celeste: But you still did it.[p/] You stood your ground.",
        "Celeste: ...Figuratively,[p/] I mean...[p/] Right now, you're kind of just sitting on the floor.",
        "Tyrion: Yeah...[p/] I need to take a moment.[p/] Can we go back to the ballroom?"
