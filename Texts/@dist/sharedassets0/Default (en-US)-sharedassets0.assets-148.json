        "Ruby: And the [i]second[/i] charge is first-degree murder.",
        "Ruby: My client would have needed to use the Sword of Spell Eating on the lock leading to the victim's study.",
        "Ruby: [i]Then[/i] she would have needed to grab a letter opener,[p/] overpower the victim,[p/] [i]and[/i] deliver a precise and fatal blow to the victim's neck.",
        "Ruby: Does [i]any[/i] of that sound like a reasonable theory, Your Honor?",
        "Judge: I'm compelled to agree with you, Ms. Tymora...",
        "Judge: It all sounds quite ludicrous,[p/] to be perfectly honest.",
        "Gallery: This is just awful.",
        "Gallery: The Steelwinds are clearly just attacking the Fregas now that their head is deceased.",
        "Aria: Enough!",
        "Aria: Your Honor.[p/] The court has [i]not[/i] seen the evidence that supports this case.",
        "Aria: Nor have you listened to the Inquisition's testimony regarding their investigation.",
        "Aria: Until you have done so,[p/] you are in no position to pass judgment.",
        "Judge: ...Very well, Ms. Steelwind.[p/] I suppose you have a point.",
        "Hmph.[p/] Guess the young lady has some claws after all.",
        "But it doesn't matter,[p/] their case against Beatrice is questionable at best.",
        "Frankly,[p/] it's surprising that Steelwind even went through with this.",
        "It's only a matter of time before the judge sees things your way.",
        "Aria: To begin,[p/] the prosecution would like to call Commander Orym White to the stand.",
        "ARIA: Commander White,[p/] please testify to the court about the Inquisition’s findings.",
        "ORYM: Right…",
        "Orym: We didn't want to cause panic after the Sword was stolen.[p/] So we activated the manor's silent security system.[p/] It put an [b]Anti-Magic Field[/b] over the entire manor.",
        "Orym: We did a search of the house.[p/] And we found the stolen sword in the defendant's bedroom.",
        "Orym: It didn't look like she was going to run,[p/] and Crown Prince Aster told us to stand down.[p/] So we just kept a close eye on her.",
        "Orym: William Frega was in a bad mood that night.[p/] So he had already locked himself inside his study.",
        "Orym: But an hour later,[p/] we entered the Study and found him lying dead in a pool of blood.",
        "Orym: The lock was still engaged,[p/] and no one teleported in.[p/] The perp must've temporarily disabled the lock using the Sword of Spell Eating.",
        "Orym: We have testimonies that say the defendant was seriously in debt.[p/] She must have murdered the victim to get a part of his inheritance.",
        "Hmph...[p/] Their case against Beatrice is just as you predicted.",
        "And you already have a countermeasure to disprove the existence of any motive.",
        "All you have to do is PRESENT that to the court.",
        "Orym: We didn't want to cause panic after the Sword was stolen.[p/] So we activated the manor's silent security system.[p/] It put an [b]Anti-Magic Field[/b] over the entire manor.",
        "Ruby: ...Wait, doesn't the Sword make the wielder immune to magical effects?",
        "Ruby: An [b]Anti-Magic Field[/b] would've only disempowered everyone [i]except[/i] the thief.",
        "Orym: Yeah, well...[p/] We didn't know what the Sword could do until [i]after[/i] the investigation.",
        "Orym: Up until then,[p/] we thought it was just a dusty old artifact.",
        "Ruby: That seems pretty negligent.[p/] Are you sure you're qualified for your position, Orym?",
        "Orym: ...",
        "Aria: The situation was unprecedented for everyone involved.",
        "Aria: One could hardly expect an ancient artifact to have magical capabilities.",
        "Orym: ...",
        "Aria: Anyways,[p/] what did you do after the theft, Commander?",
        "Orym: We did a search of the house.[p/] And we found the stolen sword in the defendant's bedroom...[p/] That's how we knew it was her.",
        "Ruby: That seems like a strange conclusion to jump to.",
        "Ruby: My client hadn't stepped foot into the Frega Manor in years.",
        "Ruby: After being gone for so long,[p/] her bedroom [i]had[/i] to have been repurposed for something else.",
        "Orym: I'm not sure about the details,[p/] but one of the defendant's sisters refused to let the servants disturb that room.",
        "Orym: I guess she was hoping that her sister would come back one day.",
        "Beatrice: Laefe...",
        "Orym: It didn't look like she was going to run,[p/] and Crown Prince Aster told us to stand down.[p/] So we just kept a close eye on her.",
        "Ruby: And why would the prince tell you to stand down, Orym?",
        "Orym: W-[p/][s/]Well...",
        "Aria: Crown Prince Aster knew the defendant well.[p/] He was confident that she wasn't going to flee the scene.",
        "Ruby: Are you sure he just \"knew her well\"?",
        "Ruby: If I recall correctly,[p/] the prince is still very adamant about her innocence.",
        "Aria: ……",
        "Judge: The Crown Prince is vouching for the defendant?",
        "Judge: Is this true, Ms. Steelwind?",
        "Aria: ...It is.[p/] However,[p/] I believe that the evidence found throughout the investigation proves the contrary.",
        "Ruby: Are you sure your judgment isn't simply being clouded by your jealousy?",
        "Ruby: Your fiancé [i]was[/i] previously engaged to my client, after all.",
        "Orym: ...",
        "Aria: ……",
        "Beatrice: You're enjoying this a bit too much...",
        "Orym: William Frega was in a bad mood that night.[p/] So he had already locked himself inside his study.",
        "Ruby: Did anyone see him enter the study?",
        "Orym: A few people.[p/] One of them was Laefe Frega:[p/] the victim's second daughter.",
        "Orym: She said that he was really irritated that night.[p/] So he went into his study for some peace and quiet.",
        "Orym: I guess his meeting with the defendant put him in a bad mood.",
        "Ruby: But if the manor was covered in an [b]Anti-Magic Field[/b],[p/] how did he lock the door magically?",
        "Orym: I'm not sure how.[p/] But the locks in the manor aren't affected by [b]Anti-Magic Fields[/b].",
        "Ruby: Um...[p/] How?",
        "Aria: The magical locks generate a smaller [b]Anti-Magic Field[/b] around themselves.",
        "Aria: The two fields cancel each other out.[p/] It's like multiplying two negative numbers together.",
        "Ruby: I'm going to be honest.[p/] I have no understanding of these things.",
        "Ruby: Is what she's saying true, Beatrice?",
        "Beatrice: Yes.[p/] Overlapping [b]Anti-Magic Fields[/b] are a well-studied phenomenon.",
        "You'll just have to take her word for it...",
        "Orym: But an hour later,[p/] we entered the Study and found him lying dead in a pool of blood.",
        "Ruby: Who was the person that discovered the body?",
        "Orym: The same person who saw him last.[p/] His daughter:[p/] Laefe Frega.",
        "Beatrice: ...Poor Laefe.[p/] That must have been traumatizing for her.",
        "Ruby: ...Did anyone else accompany Laefe when she happened upon the body?",
        "Orym: Yeah.[p/] Supposedly,[p/] one of the servants got himself locked in a nearby storage closet.",
        "Orym: And he heard the violent attack through one of the air vents.",
        "Orym: When he finally got out,[p/] he told Laefe and they went into the study accompanied by some knights.",
        "Orym: The lock was still engaged,[p/] and no one teleported in.[p/] The perp must've temporarily disabled the lock using something like the Sword of Spell Eating.",
        "Ruby: This sword is integral to the case against my client.[p/] So why is the description of its capabilities so vague?",
        "Orym: To be honest,[p/] the Sword [i]is[/i] magic.[p/] But it doesn't seem to behave like any spells we know about.",
        "Orym: And we can't identify its magic like we usually do with artificery devices.",
        "Orym: ...According to Lord Haroldson,[p/] its powers are \"demonic\" in nature.",
        "Orym: But if you ask me,[p/] it's all a bunch of hooey.",
        "Beatrice: ……",
        "Orym: Anyways,[p/] it's obvious that it doesn't follow the normal rules of magic.",
        "Ruby: Wait...[p/][s/] What?",
        "Judge: What is it, Ms. Tymora?",
        "Ruby: I-[p/][s/]It's nothing.",
        "Cuthbert is watching from the gallery.[p/] So he must have heard that too.",
        "Could the Eye of Horus have something to do with demons?",
        "...No.[p/] Focus on acquitting the client, first.[p/] You can worry about Cuthbert later.",
        "Aria: Either way,[p/] we've tested the Sword's magic on similar locks.",
        "Aria: When used correctly,[p/] it [i]is[/i] capable of disabling the lock on Lord Frega's study.",
        "Orym: We have testimonies that say the defendant was seriously in debt.[p/] She must have murdered the victim to get a part of his inheritance.",
        "Ruby: You have \"testimonies\"?",
        "Ruby: Wouldn't an official record be more valid evidence?",
        "Aria: ...Ms. Tymora.[p/] You and I [i]both[/i] know that your client's creditors are not the type to keep such records.",
        "Ruby: So you're admitting that you're relying on hearsay.",
        "Aria: One [i]could[/i] conclude that.",
        "Aria: But it doesn't matter if we can prove that this debt exists.[p/] The Frega estate is unimaginably vast.",
        "Aria: Debt or no debt,[p/] that amount of wealth would be a tempting boon to any individual.",
        "She has a point.[p/] House Frega owns all of the banking houses in Wyverngarde.",
        "People can only dream of having that much power and wealth.",
        "Player: Overflow",
        "The prosecution's case against Beatrice is already really weak.",
        "You're not even sure why they bothered bringing this to trial in the first place.",
        "And you already have testimony from someone else that directly contradicts the commander's testimony.",
        "Once you PRESENT that to the court,[p/] this case is as good as yours.",
        "Player: Objection",
        "Player: Beatrice's Inheritance",
        "Player: Default",
        "Ruby: Your Honor.[p/] The witness's testimony contradicts [i]this[/i] piece of evidence.",
        "Judge: My apologies, Ms. Tymora...",
        "Judge: But I fail to see [i]any[/i] contradiction there.",
        "Ruby: Perhaps you should look harder, Your Honor.",
        "Aria: Or perhaps [i]you[/i] should stop making such careless claims.",
        "Ruby: R-[p/][s/]Right...",
        "What's wrong with you?[p/] You're usually much less careless.",
        "You have the evidence you need.[p/] Just PRESENT it to the court.",
        "Player: Back",
        "Ruby: Your Honor.[p/] The prosecution's case against my client is riddled with holes.",
        "Ruby: And the prosecution's proposed \"motive\" is the largest among them.",
        "Judge: What do you mean, Ms. Tymora?",
        "Judge: Of all the elements in this case,[p/] the motive is the most believable.",
        "Judge: Your client would have had much to gain through her father's inheritance.",
        "Ruby: That may be.",
        "Ruby: ...But that's assuming my client had [i]anything[/i] to inherit at all!",
        "Aria: ...What?",
        "Ruby: Your Honor,[p/] my client fled from her psychologically abusive father five years ago.",
        "Ruby: How do you think [i]he[/i] would have reacted to that?",
        "Ruby: Lord Frega was a petty and vindictive man.",
        "Ruby: Do you honestly think that he'd leave his inheritance to someone who disobeyed him so egregiously?",
        "Ruby: ...No.[p/][s/] He'd do everything in his power to make sure she didn't see a [i]shred[/i] of his wealth!",
        "Aria: Yes.[p/] We're already well aware of this.",
        "The moment she slams her cane down,[p/] you notice the prosecutor wince a little.",
        "But she quickly hides it and regains her composure.",
        "Aria: ...On the night of the murder,[p/] the victim made the decision to disinherit the defendant.",
        "Aria: However,[p/] his murder deprived him of the opportunity to submit his will to his attorney.",
        "Aria: This only further proves the defendant's motive.",
        "Aria: She would have needed to act quickly.[p/] Lest her father submit the changed will.",
        "Ruby: I'm afraid [i]you're[/i] mistaken, Steelwind.[p/] William Frega didn't disinherit my client that night.",
        "Ruby: He disinherited my client five years ago!",
        "Ruby: I have witness testimony from Miriam Frega:[p/] William's youngest daughter.",
        "Ruby: By her own admission,[p/][s/] her father disinherited my client shortly after she fled the household!",
        "Aria: ...What?!",
        "Aria: She...[p/] never brought that up during questioning...",
        "Ruby: Perhaps she's not as amicable to you as you thought.",
        "Ruby: If you don't believe me,[p/][s/] why don't we call her to the stand and ask her ourselves?!",
        "Aria: ……",
        "Aria: ...What are you planning, Ms. Tymora?",
        "Ruby: I have [i]no[/i] idea what you're talking about.",
        "Aria: ...Well,[p/] it's clear we won't get anywhere until we hear from Miriam directly.",
        "Aria: Bailiff,[p/] please escort Miriam Frega to the stand.",
        "ARIA: ...Miriam.[p/] Is the defense correct?",
        "Aria: Did your father disinherit Beatrice five years ago?",
        "Miriam: Y-[p/][s/]Yes...",
        "Aria: ...And you didn't think it was [i]necessary[/i] to share this information with me?",
        "Miriam: W-[p/][s/]Well...[p/] You never asked.",
        "Aria: ……",
        "Aria: If I recall correctly,[p/] you also were tight-lipped during questioning this morning.",
        "Aria: Are you staying quiet for your sister's sake?",
        "Miriam: ...",
        "Ruby: The witness just lost her father.",
        "Ruby: You can hardly expect her to recall [i]every[/i] detail that's relevant to the case.",
        "Aria: ...Which raises a more concerning question:[p/] how did [i]you[/i] extract this information?",
        "Ruby: Who knows?[p/] Maybe I just have a way with people.",
        "Aria: ……",
        "Aria: Regardless,[p/] I suppose you have a point.[p/] I'll give the witness the benefit of the doubt...[p/] for now.",
        "Aria: In any case, Miriam,[p/] please testify to the court about [i]how[/i] you found out about Beatrice's disinheritance.",
        "Miriam: Y-[p/][s/]Yes.[p/] Of course...",
        "Miriam: One day,[p/] we all woke up and discovered that Beatrice had fled from our home.",
        "Miriam: She left a note for us.[p/] And in it,[p/] she renounced her name and denounced my father.",
        "Miriam: My father later called me and my sister into his study.[p/] He told us that he'd completely disowned Beatrice and removed any claim she had to the Frega estate.",
        "Miriam: It was probably a threat to us in case [i]we[/i] ever chose to go down the same path she did.[p/] He wanted to make an example out of her.",
        "Miriam: This all happened five years ago.",
        "Aria: ...And are you sure this all happened five years ago?",
        "Miriam: Y-[p/][s/]Yes...[p/] Even now,[p/] I can remember everything clearly...",
        "Aria: I...[p/] see.",
        "Her speech is getting slower.[p/] Is she deep in thought?",
        "Nightgrave seems extremely concerned for some reason.",
        "Aria: And Laefe was there with you at this meeting?",
        "Miriam: Y-[p/][s/]Yes...[p/] She was.",
        "Aria: I...",
        "Aria: However,[p/] Laefe couldn't have possibly been there.",
        "Her words are getting more slurred.[p/] You also notice that her balance is slightly swaying.",
        "Ruby: Hey...[p/] Are you okay?",
        "Aria: Of course, I...",
        "Aria: I...",
        "Ruby: W-[p/][s/]What?!",
        "Beatrice: ……",
        "Judge: By the Scaled Lord![p/][s/] Is that...[p/][s/] blood?!",
        "Ruby: B-[p/]Blood?!",
        "Judge: B-[p/][s/]Bailiff![p/][s/] Find [i]anyone[/i] capable of casting healing magic!",
        "Judge: Escort them to the courtroom immediately!",
        "After some scrambling,[p/] a couple of healers are able to help Nightgrave stabilize the prosecutor.",
        "In all the chaos,[p/] you caught a glimpse of her.[p/] There were deep wounds and blood on several parts of her body.",
        "She must have used some kind of illusion to hide them.[p/] But her disguise has completely dissipated now.",
        "Before Steelwind is taken out of the courtroom,[p/] you catch her whispering something into Nightgrave's ear.",
        "You see a look of confusion from him.[p/] But he nods and makes his way to the witness stand.",
        "...But not before passing a message onto the bailiff,[p/] who seems equally confused.",
        "Just what the hell is going on?",
        "Judge: Mr. Nightgrave![p/][s/] Explain yourself!",
        "Judge: What is going on?![p/][s/] Why was Ms. Steelwind so gravely injured?!",
        "Wallace: I'm sorry...",
        "Wallace: But I wasn't actually here as Ms. Steelwind's aide.[p/] I was here as her healer.",
        "Ruby: ...Her healer?",
        "Wallace: The truth is...[p/] Ms. Steelwind was violently attacked at noon today.",
        "Wallace: She was in critical condition.[p/] But she insisted on prosecuting the case anyways.",
        "Wallace: I owed her a favor.[p/] And she asked me to channel my [b]necromancy[/b] to keep her wounds closed during the trial.",
        "Judge: Scaled Lord![p/][s/] Why didn't she just recuse herself?!",
        "She must have known...",
        "If anyone else tried to prosecute Beatrice,[p/] you would have handily won the trial.",
        "Nevertheless,[p/] she showed up to prosecute because no one else would.[p/] And she did it all despite the risk to her life...",
        "It almost makes you respect her a little.",
        "Almost...",
        "Ruby: Anyways,[p/] is there any need to prolong this trial, Your Honor?",
        "Judge: W-[p/][s/]What?!",
        "Ruby: Even [i]you[/i] must acknowledge how weak the case against my client is.",
        "Ruby: In addition to that,[p/] Miriam's testimony shows that my client had nothing to gain from her father's death.",
        "Judge: M-[p/][s/]Ms. Tymora![p/][s/] Ms. Steelwind has been gravely injured!",
        "Judge: And you're still only concerned about-!",
        "Ruby: The only thing I'm \"concerned\" about is seeking justice for my client.",
        "Judge: E-[p/][s/]Even so...[p/] We cannot move forward until we find another prosecutor.",
        "Ruby: And how long do you think that will take, Your Honor?",
        "Ruby: It's almost been twelve hours since the murder took place.",
        "Ruby: That gives us what?[p/] Thirty-six hours?[p/]",
        "Ruby: After that,[p/] every magical trace at the crime scene will fully disappear.",
        "Wallace: B-[p/][s/]But there [i]might[/i] be someone-",
        "Ruby: If Steelwind had simply allowed [i]another[/i] prosecutor to work this case,[p/] we wouldn't be in this situation.",
        "Ruby: She took a risk and now she has to pay the price.[p/] Wouldn't you agree, Your Honor?",
        "Judge: ...",
        "You're not exactly proud of winning this way.",
        "But this is what it takes to win.[p/] And you won't let an opportunity like this pass you by.",
        "Judge: ...",
        "The judge is clearly unhappy with this turn of events.",
        "But it's out of his hands now.",
        "Judge: Well...[p/] Due to today's unprecedented events,[p/] I suppose I have no choice.",
        "Judge: There aren't any prosecutors available to immediately take Ms. Steelwind's place.",
        "Judge: We will take a brief recess.[p/] After that,[p/] I'll deliver my verdict.",
        "Tyrion: Your Honor![p/][s/] I'm afraid you can't pass a verdict just yet!",
        "Judge: M-[p/][s/]Mr. Cuthbert?!",
        "Ruby: ...Cuthbert?",
        "Ruby: What the hell are you doing?!",
        "Tyrion: I...[p/] don't know.",
        "Tyrion: But what I [i]do[/i] know is that there was a massive contradiction in Miriam Frega's testimony!",
        "But it looks like things aren't going to be as simple as you expected...",
        "Tyrion: Your Honor![p/][s/] The defense-...[p/][s/] I mean the prosecution-...",
        "Tyrion: [i]I[/i] would like the right to cross-examine this witness!",
        "Judge: ...",
        "Judge: Bailiff.[p/] Please arrest Mr. Cuthbert.[p/] I am holding him in contempt of court.",
        "Tyrion: O-[p/][s/]Oh...[p/] W-[p/][s/]Wait!",
        "You didn't really think this through, did you...?",
        "Instead of following his orders,[p/] the bailiff walks over to the judge's podium and whispers something into his ear.",
        "Judge: ...What?",
        "Judge: ...",
        "Judge: I see.[p/] Very well, then.",
        "...What are they saying?",
        "Judge: It appears that Ms. Steelwind has [i]somehow[/i] predicted that this would happen.",
        "Judge: In accordance with her wishes,[p/] Mr. Cuthbert may act as the prosecutor in her stead.",
        "Ruby: ...What the hell?![p/][s/] You can't be serious!",
        "Judge: I am honestly just as surprised as you are, Ms. Tymora.",
        "Judge: But Ms. Steelwind has apparently designated him as her stand-in.",
        "Judge: It's unorthodox,[p/] but it's also legal.",
        "You recall something strange Steelwind asked you earlier today.",
        "Aria: So...[p/] What would you do if one of your clients was guilty?",
        "Tyrion: I suppose...[p/] I'd withdraw and tell them to find another lawyer.",
        "Aria: And if no one else would represent them?",
        "Tyrion: ...I don't know.[p/] It would definitely be a hard choice for me.",
        "Tyrion: But...[p/] I would never be able to represent them if I knew the truth.",
        "Tyrion: I just...[p/] can't stand by and let a murderer escape justice.",
        "Aria: I...[p/] see.",
        "Steelwind...[p/] Did she somehow [i]know[/i] this would happen?",
        "Celeste: Well...[p/] [i]this[/i] isn't how I expected the trial to go...",
        "Shortly after you barged onto the prosecutor's table,[p/] Celeste awkwardly followed behind you.",
        "...Curiously,[p/] she only did so [i]after[/i] the bailiff didn't arrest you.",
        "Celeste: *sigh*[p/] I guess we're really doing this...",
        "Celeste: ……",
        "Tyrion: What's wrong?",
        "Celeste: This feels weird.[p/] We're on the other side of the courtroom.",

        "Harold: I called him telepathically.[p/] But he didn't respond.",
        "Tyrion: Does he typically ignore you like that?",
        "Harold: Sometimes.[p/] He's a young boy.[p/] So he likes to have his privacy.",
        "Harold: I try not to pry.[p/] But I was wary of what would happen if a noble or a knight came across him.",
        "Harold: He usually knows not to bother people.[p/] But you never know what might happen.",

        "Tyrion: Where did you go during your search?",
        "Harold: Eugene usually knows to stay out of people's bedrooms.[p/] So I went downstairs and searched for him there.",
        "Harold: I checked the Bathroom,[p/] Sitting Room,[p/] and Coat Room.",
        "Harold: Then I finally checked the Kitchen and Pantry.[p/] He might have gone there to steal some snacks.",

        "Harold: Honestly,[p/] not much.",

        "Harold: ...What?",
        "Tyrion: Harold.[p/] In response to the theft,[p/] the Kingsguard activated the lockdown system to prevent anyone from leaving.",

        "Harold: And what reason would I have to steal something that already belongs to me?",
        "Tyrion: It was to take suspicion off of you.[p/][s/] Because [i]you[/i] were the one who had William Frega killed!",
        "Tyrion: You staged a robbery and used the Sword of Spell Eating to make Eugene invisible!",

        "Tyrion: ...On what grounds, Ms. Tymora?",
        "Ruby: On what [i]grounds[/i]?!",
        "Ruby: [i]Everything[/i] about this situation is objectionable!",
        "Ruby: It's downright absurd! [mind=\"Is <i>he</i> seriously Beatrice's accomplice?!\"/]",
        "Judge: B-[p/][s/]But, Ms. Tymora...",
        "Judge: We can't deny what's clearly in front of us.",
        "Ruby: ……",
        "Celeste: ...I was not ready for today.",
        "Celeste: How is he even talking right now?",
        "Tyrion: Scholars believe that humans and apes evolved from a common ancestor.",
        "Tyrion: Perhaps [i]all[/i] apes can speak the Common language under the right circumstances.",
        "Eugene: \"Evolved\"?[p/] Please,[p/] I've observed your society.",
        "Eugene: I think calling humanity \"evolved\" is being quite generous.",
        "Ruby: This can't be happening...",
        "Eugene: Well?[p/] Are you all done gawking at me like a bunch of simpletons?",
        "\"Simpletons\"...?",
        "Tyrion: Wait a minute...",
        "Harold: It's quite difficult to separate myths from actual historical accounts.",
        "Tyrion: Right...[p/] I remember encountering a similar problem at the Imperial Academy...",
        "Harold: Ah,[p/] you must be quite dedicated to your studies. [mind=\"They let this simpleton into the Imperial Academy?!\"/]",
        "Rude...[p/] But you suppose that can't be helped.",
        "Every insulting thought that you've seen from Harold.[p/][s/] They weren't Harold's thoughts at all!",
        "They were [i]Eugene's[/i] thoughts![p/][s/] He's been wearing the Armbands since you first met!",
        "Tyrion: But I still don't understand...",
        "Tyrion: Why would you even take the Armbands in the first place?",
        "Eugene: ...I'll admit that the Lords' Ball was one of many occasions.",
        "Eugene: The [i]first[/i] time I touched them was due to sheer chance.",
        "Tyrion: You put them on by accident?",
        "Eugene: My unawakened self was enamored by its glittering sheen.",
        "Eugene: I merely wanted to touch them.[p/] But when I first held them in my hands,[p/] I experienced a sense of clarity that I'd never felt before.",
        "Eugene: I was afraid of what I'd experienced.[p/] So I left them alone.",
        "Eugene: ...But as I returned to my primitive lifestyle,[p/] I couldn't stop thinking about what I felt that day.",
        "Tyrion: You were hooked.",
        "Eugene: I wouldn't [i]quite[/i] phrase it like that,[p/] but I suppose you're not wrong.",
        "Eugene: I already knew the password to Harold's vault.[p/] So I'd come in from time to time and indulge in the Armbands' power.",
        "Eugene: But the more time I spent with my awakened intellect,[p/] the more I craved its power when I had to put them away.",
        "Tyrion: ...And that's when you made the replica.",
        "Eugene: While no one was watching,[p/] I devised a plan to discreetly take the Armbands.",
        "Eugene: Harold would have eventually discovered that they were stolen.[p/] But he would have concluded that a noble from the Lords' Ball took them.",
        "Tyrion: Because of the pressure that he was receiving from the Crown.",
        "Eugene: I'm not proud of what I've done.[p/] But I never expected things to reach this point.",
        "Eugene: I didn't expect someone to steal the Sword of Spell Eating as well.",
        "Eugene: And I certainly didn't expect a murder to happen that night.",
        "Tyrion: So you still maintain that you're innocent.",
        "Eugene: Of course, I do.",
        "Eugene: I stole the Armbands,[p/] but I did [i]not[/i] murder William Frega.[p/] Nor did I take the Sword of Spell Eating.",
        "Eugene: ...Allow me to elaborate.",
        "Eugene: I'll admit that I took the Armbands and replaced them with a replica.[p/] But I was [i]not[/i] the crook who stole the Sword of Spell Eating.",
        "Eugene: The thefts were completely different from one another.[p/] The display case for the Sword was completely shattered.",
        "Eugene: I spotted the Sword when I was exploring the manor.[p/] It was lying in the middle of a hallway.",
        "Eugene: I wondered why such an important artifact would be lying there.[p/] So I took a closer look to inspect it.",
        "Eugene: That's when I heard Harold call out to me telepathically.[p/] The Sword must have protected me and Harold from the [b]Anti-Magic Field[/b].",
        "Eugene: I wanted to take the Sword and return it.[p/] But a wild dog chased me away from the scene.",
        "Celeste: He has a point...[p/] He didn't need to shatter the display case of the Sword.",
        "Tyrion: Yeah,[p/] he already knew the passwords.",
        "But Tracker said that [i]Eugene[/i] was the one who dropped the Sword.",
        "Furthermore,[p/] he escaped into the air vent that led into William's Study.",
        "His actions that night were definitely not as innocent as his testimony implies.",
        "He must have lied [i]somewhere[/i].",
        "Eugene: I'll admit that I took the Armbands and replaced them with a replica.[p/] But I was [i]not[/i] the crook who stole the Sword of Spell Eating.",
        "Tyrion: You stole the Armbands by using Harold's spoken password?[p/] Am I correct?",
        "Eugene: Yes.[p/] I sit on his shoulder most of the time.",
        "Eugene: He obviously never suspected what I'd do.[p/] So it was a simple matter of listening to him when he transported the artifacts to Frega Manor.",
        "Tyrion: And can I assume that you knew the passwords for the other displays as well?",
        "Eugene: I do.[p/] And I can easily demonstrate it.",
        "You doubt that he'd lie about that when you can easily check it.",
        "Tyrion: Even so,[p/] you already lied about not stealing the Armbands.",
        "Tyrion: Why should we believe you now?",
        "Eugene: The answer to that lies in the physical evidence.",
        "Eugene: The thefts were completely different from one another.[p/] The display case for the Sword was completely shattered.",
        "Tyrion: How do we know that you didn't shatter the glass to cover your tracks?",
        "Eugene: Harold's password nullifies the locks.[p/] But they don't nullify the magic that protects the glass.",
        "Eugene: Harold told you himself, didn't he?[p/] Only a powerful mage could have shattered the reinforced glass.",
        "Tyrion: But as a familiar,[p/] magic [i]can[/i] be cast through you.",
        "Eugene: Only Harold can cast magic through me.[p/] I can't cast any spells by myself.",
        "Eugene: And even if I could,[p/] Harold's [b]Spell Compendium[/b] doesn't have a spell that's powerful enough for that.",
        "His logic is sound...",
        "But if what he's saying is true,[p/] [i]who[/i] shattered the glass?",
        "Eugene: Anyways...",
        "Eugene: I spotted the Sword when I was exploring the manor.[p/] It was lying in the middle of a hallway.",
        "Tyrion: But [i]that[/i] location was near the Fregas' bedrooms...",
        "Tyrion: Don't tell me that you-...",
        "Eugene: What do you take me for?!",
        "Eugene: I [i]know[/i] what a bedroom looks like![p/][s/] And I'd never enter one uninvited!",
        "Tyrion: Then why were you there in this first place?",
        "Eugene: ...I was coming back from the Rooftop Garden.[p/] But I suddenly felt something interfering with the Armbands' magic.",
        "Tyrion: The [b]Anti-Magic Fields[/b].",
        "Eugene: Yes.[p/] I was worried that something had happened so I made my way back to the Gallery to meet up with Harold.",
        "Tyrion: I see...[p/] Could you add this to your testimony?",
        "Eugene: ...Very well.",
        "Eugene: I spotted the Sword when I was heading back from the Rooftop Garden to the Gallery.[p/] It was lying in the middle of a hallway.",
        "Tyrion: So you were heading directly from the Rooftop Garden to the Gallery.",
        "Tyrion: But do you honestly expect us to believe that someone just [i]left[/i] the Sword of Spell Eating in that hallway?",
        "Eugene: Think what you will.[p/] But it's the truth.",
        "Eugene: Perhaps the murderer left it there after they were done using it.",
        "Eugene: If the Kingsguard found it there,[p/] they would have had no idea who stole it.",
        "That [i]does[/i] sound possible.[p/] But you shouldn't be so quick to believe him.",
        "Eugene: I wondered why such an important artifact would be lying there.[p/] So I took a closer look to inspect it.",
        "Tyrion: And [i]that's[/i] when you made contact with it?",
        "Eugene: Yes.[p/] I was quite surprised too.",
        "Eugene: At the time,[p/] the magic of the Armbands was being nullified.",
        "Eugene: But when I picked up the Sword,[p/] my intelligence finally returned.",
        "Eugene: That's how I knew that I was holding the Sword of Spell Eating.",
        "Eugene: That's when I heard Harold call out to me telepathically.[p/] The Sword must have protected me and Harold from the [b]Anti-Magic Field[/b].",
        "Tyrion: Was this the first time he tried to contact you this night?",
        "Eugene: No.[p/] He had telepathically messaged me earlier that night.",
        "Eugene: ...But I was so absorbed in my exploration that I ignored him.",
        "He was \"absorbed\" into his exploration?[p/] Would that really cause him to ignore a call from Harold?",
        "Eugene: I wanted to take the Sword and return it.[p/] But a wild dog chased me away from the scene.",
        "Tyrion: Didn't you have enough time to grab the sword?[p/] You [i]were[/i] holding it after all.",
        "Eugene: I'm not proud to admit it.[p/] But my survival instincts took over.",
        "Eugene: At that point,[p/] I was more concerned about escaping that wild animal.",
        "You suppose that makes sense.",
        "Tracker is several times larger than him.[p/] He had every reason to be afraid.",
        "Player: Overflow",
        "Celeste: His story makes sense...[p/] There's no way [i]he[/i] could have shattered the glass.",
        "Tyrion: I suppose so...",
        "Tyrion: But Tracker saw him that night.[p/] He was definitely traversing the vents in that hallway.",

        "Eugene: I, unfortunately, do not...",
        "Ruby: Please.[p/] It's obvious your testimony doesn't match up with the evidence.",
        "Ruby: Whoever did this either entered through the vents [i]or[/i] they used the Sword to nullify the lock.",

        "Tyrion: Anyways,[p/] what did you do when you discovered the body?",

        "Eugene: And as if I were blessed by the Scaled Lord himself,[p/] I found the will that he was drafting.[p/] So I destroyed it.",

        "Eugene: Since he went out of his way to specify that on the current copy,[p/] I concluded that his former will didn't have this addendum.",
        "Tyrion: So you could save Harold's museum by making sure it never got submitted for probate.",
        "Tyrion: Anyways,[p/] do you have the will with you?",

        "Tyrion: Tracker.[p/] You said you had to [i]smell[/i] to \"see\" where the rat was?",
        "Tyrion: And when he dropped his \"stick\" you were finally able to see him.",
        "Tyrion: Does this mean you couldn't [i]visually[/i] see him [i]before[/i] he fell down?",
        "Tracker: Yeah.[p/] Tracker couldn't see the rat with his eyes.[p/] So Tracker used his nose to see it.",
        "Celeste: ...Eugene was invisible!",
        "Tyrion: Eugene.[p/] When you were carrying out your plan,[p/] did you turn yourself invisible somehow?",
        "Eugene: ...No?[p/] I hardly had the means to.",
        "Eugene: And even if I [i]had[/i] somehow convinced Harold to cast a spell on me,[p/] he doesn't know how to cast [b]Invisibility[/b].",
        "Eugene: Very few mages do.",
        "Right.[p/] You recall Eris saying the same thing during the Nightgrave trials.",
        "Only a master of [b]illusion[/b] magic could do that.[p/] That's how you first thought Beatrice was involved.",
        "But if Eugene is truly innocent,[p/] did she turn someone [i]else[/i] invisible?",
        "But if that's true,[p/][s/] you're back right where you started again!",
        "No...[p/] Think through this.",
        "Eugene's testimony fills in a blank that's been missing.",
        "Eugene: I fell to the ground and found the Sword of Spell Eating laying next to me.",
        "Tyrion: How did you know it was the Sword of Spell Eating?",
        "Eugene: When I held it in my hands,[p/] I felt my intelligence return...",
        "Eugene: But I also heard Harold calling out to me telepathically.",
        "Eugene: He was clearly growing worried.[p/] So I knew I needed to move quickly.",
        "Eugene: I wanted to retrieve the Sword.[p/] But that wild dog forced me to retreat.[p/] After that,[p/] I continued to make my way to the study.",
        "And what happens when you cross-reference that with Tracker's testimony...",
        "Tracker: That's when Tracker smell flying rat.",
        "Tracker: Tracker could smell where rat was,[p/] so Tracker bork at him.",
        "Tracker: Tracker must have scared rat.[p/] Because he fell onto the floor and dropped his stick.",
        "So where does that lead us?",
        "Player: 小偷把 剑 掉到了 走廊里",
        "Player: Fail",
        "No...[p/] In Eugene's testimony,[p/] he fell onto the ground.",
        "And when he got his bearings,[p/] he realized that Sword was lying next to him.",
        "But Tracker said that the \"rat\" dropped the Sword when he fell onto the ground.",
        "These testimonies appear to conflict with each other,[p/] but what's the commonality between them?",
        "The thief dropped the Sword in that hallway.",
        "...But how does [i]that[/i] make sense?",
        "Did they hide the Sword there like you originally thought?",
        "No...[p/] That hallway was close to the Gallery.[p/] There were plenty of better places to hide the Sword.",
        "If it weren't for Tracker taking it,[p/] it would've been found even sooner.",
        "The thief must have accidentally dropped the sword there...[p/] This can only mean one thing.",
        "Player: 窃贼 从通风管道 之中 潜入",
        "Player: Fail",
        "No...[p/] That hallway leads toward the Bath.",
        "You can think of very little reason why the thief would be [i]walking[/i] there.",
        "But there's another explanation for why they were at that specific location.",
        "The thief was also sneaking through the air vents...",
        "That's the only reason why they would be there.",
        "But that would imply that the thief was as small as Eugene...",
        "Could it have been [i]another[/i] familiar?[p/] And if so,[p/] why didn't Eugene notice them?",
        "Wait...",
        "Eugene: I'm not sure if it was my waning intelligence or my desperation.[p/] But I collided with something that I didn't see.",
        "He collided with something he \"didn't\" see...[p/] In other words,[p/] it was something that wasn't visible to him.",
        "And as a master of [b]illusion[/b] magic,[p/] Beatrice is one of the few people at the Ball that [i]could[/i] cast [b]Invisibility[/b]...",
        "Liafal: Beatrice would never trust anyone enough to work together like this.",
        "Tyrion: But she's completely blind.[p/] She wouldn't have much of a choice.",
        "Liafal: Even so,[p/] she's not the type of person to trust her accomplice to stay quiet.",
        "Liafal: She'd find a way to carry out a plan herself.[p/] And she'd only employ someone else's help if she had full control of them.",
        "Have you been approaching this situation incorrectly the entire time?",
        "Through the Eye,[p/] you knew that Beatrice was involved somehow.[p/] But you just assumed that she was one part of a larger plot.",
        "The breaking of the glass and the casting of [b]Invisibility[/b]...",
        "These were the elements that you [i]knew[/i] she was involved with.[p/] But it never really fit together.",
        "...Not unless [i]she[/i] was the one pulling the strings the entire time.",
        "And there's only one way she could be in control the entire time.",
        "Familial Bond",
        "Default",
        "No...[p/] You've been underestimating Beatrice's role in what happened that night.",
        "Everyone assumed that Beatrice couldn't perform certain actions due to her blindness.",
        "But there's one \"tool\" that she could have used to do all of this.",
        "A couple of memories flood into your mind.",
        "Harold: A familiar is a creature that a mage has formed a magical contract with.",
        "Harold: With that contract,[p/] our souls are bonded.",
        "Harold: I can speak with him telepathically.[p/] I could even see through his eyes and cast my spells through him if I wanted to.",
        "Tyrion: Really...?[p/] I never knew a spell like that existed.",
        "Harold: It's quite rare.[p/] Very few mages take the time to learn how to cast it.",
        "Tyrion: H-[p/][s/]Hi, I'm Tyrion Cuthbert.[p/] I'm Ms. Tymora's...[p/] ward.",
        "You extend out your hand to shake hers.",
        "She has an aristocratic air to her.[p/] So you hope you're not being too informal.",
        "Instead of taking your hand,[p/] she claps her hands together and takes a deep breath.",
        "Tyrion: W-[p/][s/]What...?",
        "Beatrice: Ah![p/][s/] S-[p/][s/]Sorry.[p/] I didn't mean to do that.",
        "Beatrice: It's a bit of a habit of mine.",
        "Tyrion: O-[p/]Oh...",
        "Nevertheless,[p/] she finally shakes your hand.",
        "Beatrice: I've heard much about you, Mr. Cuthbert.[p/] My name is Beatrice.",
        "You didn't know that she was blind back then...[p/] So you barely even noticed it.",
        "But how did she know that you were holding out your hand?",
        "Eugene: Well?[p/] Do you have any other questions for me?",
        "Tyrion: ……",
        "If you're wrong about this,[p/] Beatrice will surely be acquitted.",
        "And after that,[p/] the Inquisition will turn their attention to Harold and Eugene.",
        "But there's only one way to know for sure...",
        "Tyrion: Your Honor.[p/] The prosecution has no further questions for the current witness.",
        "Tyrion: He is dismissed.",
        "Ruby: What?",
        "Eugene: I...[p/] see.",
        "Celeste: ...You have something else planned, don't you?",
        "Tyrion: Yeah...[p/] And I actually need your help.",
        "Celeste: ...Really?",
        "You tell her about your plan.",
        "Celeste: Really?[p/] I feel like you're making some big assumptions there.",
        "Celeste: Wouldn't the Inquisition check for something like that?",
        "Tyrion: I know...[p/] It's the best play we have.",
        "Tyrion: Do you remember what Steelwind said yesterday?",
        "Aria: But the moment the guards saw the body,[p/] one of them cast [b]Detect Magic[/b].",
        "Aria: With that spell,[p/] they would have seen any invisible people hiding in this room.",
        "Celeste: Wait, you can use [b]Detect Magic[/b] like that?",
        "Aria: Of course.[p/] It's standard procedure.",
        "Aria: Like all spells,[p/] [b]Invisibility[/b] leaves traces of magic on the person it's cast on.",
        "Aria: So mages can use [b]Detect Magic[/b] as a way to see through invisibility.",
        "Tyrion: If everything goes the way I think it will,[p/] you'll be able to confirm its location.",
        "Tyrion: Once you do that,[p/] you just need to reveal it to everyone.",
        "Celeste: Alright...[p/] I'll follow your lead then.",
        "Judge: So, Mr. Cuthbert?[p/] How do we proceed?",
        "Judge: Your [i]previous[/i] witness brought about more revelations than I could have ever guessed.",
        "Judge: However,[p/] you still haven't given a substantial explanation about [i]how[/i] the murder occurred or [i]who[/i] actually did it.",
        "Tyrion: I understand that, Your Honor.",
        "Tyrion: But it will all make sense after I call my next witness.",
        "Judge: ...[i]Another[/i] witness?",
        "Tyrion: I understand your hesitance, Your Honor.[p/] But everything that we've learned throughout these trials is finally coming together.",
        "Tyrion: And this final witness will tie it all together in a perfect knot.",
        "Tyrion: Your Honor.[p/] The prosecution calls Beatrice Frega to the stand.",
        "Ruby: Seriously, Cuthbert?[p/] You went to [i]all[/i] that trouble just to end up calling my client to the stand?",
        "Tyrion: You and your client have the right to refuse, Ms. Tymora.",
        "Tyrion: But I wonder how that will reflect on your client's character.",
        "It doesn't really matter.[p/] She's already standing here with Ms. Tymora.",
        "You can carry out your plan regardless of what she decides to do.",
        "...But it will have much more impact if you can bait her into lying on the stand.",
        "Ruby: ……",
        "Ruby: My client says that she's willing to testify.",
        "Ruby: However,[p/] we would like to propose a short recess.",
        "Ruby: With these new developments,[p/] I'm sure you can understand that we have much to discuss.",
        "Judge: Hm...[p/] I see no reason not to grant the defense's request.",
        "Celeste: Is this really okay?",
        "Celeste: If we give them time to prep,[p/] they might realize what we're doing.",
        "Tyrion: I know...[p/] But I don't think we have anything to worry about.",
        "You've been building a psychological profile of Beatrice since this case began.",
        "It's hard to read her expression and emotions,[p/] even [i]with[/i] the Eye of Horus.",
        "She keeps herself guarded and keeps her true intentions unknown.",
        "She's powerful.[p/] More powerful than her father ever cared to admit.",
        "Despite this,[p/] he tried to control her and put her inside a cage.",
        "...But Beatrice Frega would never live in a cage.",
        "She wanted freedom and control.[p/] And she would do whatever it took to get it.",
        "You're sure the accident that blinded her didn't help things.",
        "When everything was said and done,[p/] she abandoned everything.[p/] Her wealth,[p/] her status,[p/] her family.",
        "She could have waited.[p/] She could have gritted her teeth until it was her turn to lead House Frega.",
        "If she was willing,[p/] she could have even secretly pushed her father past the gates of death herself.",
        "But she couldn't bear to live like that,[p/] even temporarily.",
        "You have no idea why [i]this[/i] is how she chose to do that.",
        "Perhaps it had something to do with their meeting...",
        "But you do know one thing.",
        "Beatrice Frega will never put herself in a position of vulnerability.",
        "If you endanger her freedom,[p/] she will make sure that she can \"see\" who she's up against.",
        "Judge: In the interest of giving the defense time to deliberate,[p/] we will be taking an extended recess.",
        "Judge: Court is adjourned.",
        "As you were exiting the courtroom,[p/] you sent Celeste to do some reconnaissance.",
        "It should be similar to when she scanned Valentina during the Nightgrave trial.",
        "Celeste: ...Tyrion.",
        "Tyrion: Celeste.[p/] Were you able to see it?",
        "Celeste: Yeah.[p/] It's definitely there.[p/] And it sits on her shoulder most of the time.",
        "Tyrion: So she keeps it close to her...[p/] That's good to know.",
        "Celeste: It looks kind of weird, though...[p/] But I've never used [b]Detect Magic[/b] like this before.",
        "Well, you doubt that someone like her would choose a conventional animal,[p/] especially for something like this.",
        "Ruby: ...Cuthbert.",
        "Tyrion: M-[p/][s/]Ms. Tymora...",
        "Ruby: ……",
        "Ruby: There's...[p/] something I need to show you.",
        "Ruby: ... Preferably, alone.",
        "Celeste gives you a concerned look.[p/] But you nod to show her it's okay.",
        "She moves to sit on the bench where she can keep an eye on Beatrice.",
        "Tyrion: ...Okay.[p/] Lead the way.",
        "Ruby: ……",
        "Judge: Court is now resumed for the trial of Beatrice Frega.",
        "Tyrion: Is the defendant prepared to take the stand?",
        "Ruby: ……",
        "Tyrion: Tymora.[p/] I asked you a question.",
        "Tyrion: Is the defendant prepped or not?",
        "Ruby: ...She is.[p/] If the prosecution still wants to move forward with-.",
        "Tyrion: The prosecution [i]will[/i] be moving forward with this.[p/] Please bring in the witness.",
        "Ruby: ……",
        "Tyrion: Do you still see it, Celeste?",
        "Celeste: Yeah...[p/] It's still there.[p/] Should I reveal it now?",
        "Tyrion: No...[p/] Let's really make a point of it.[p/] Wait for my signal.",
        "Tyrion: Thank you for agreeing to take the stand, Ms. Frega.",
        "Beatrice: ...Mr. Cuthbert.",
        "Tyrion: It's my understanding that you were with the two princes for most of the night.",
        "Beatrice: Yes, I was.",
        "Beatrice: Which is why I'm [i]still[/i] quite confused as to why I'm being charged for this crime.",
        "Beatrice: Out of everyone there that night,[p/] I'd have thought my alibi was the most solid.",
        "Tyrion: ...That remains to be seen.",
        "Beatrice: Clearly.",
        "Tyrion: Anyways...[p/] Since you still maintain your innocence,[p/] you'll have no problem going into detail about your supposed alibi.",
        "Beatrice: ……",
        "Beatrice: As you know,[p/] I was with Crown Prince Aster and Prince Alaric for most of the Ball.",
        "Beatrice: I went there after my meeting with my father.[p/] And I remained with them until I was arrested for his murder.",
        "Beatrice: Lord Steelwind and the Kingsguard kept watch over me for the entire night as well.",
        "Beatrice: I neither had the means nor the opportunity to steal the Sword of Spell Eating [i]and[/i] break into my father's study to murder him.",
        "Tyrion: And [i]that[/i],[p/] Ms. Frega,[p/] is where you're mistaken.",
        "Tyrion: You definitely had the [i]means[/i] to commit both crimes while under the eye of everyone there that night.",
        "Beatrice: ……",
        "The most effective tool an attorney has is revealing a contradiction in a witness's testimony.",
        "It not only completely shatters your opponent's argument.[p/] It also makes the court doubt whether the witness is acting in good faith.",
        "Usually,[p/] you've used evidence to reveal contradictions like this.",
        "Tyrion: Now, Celeste!",
        "Celeste: [b]Aburio[/b]!",
        "Beatrice: Wait...[p/] What are you doing?",
        "Tyrion: Your Honor![p/][s/] The witness's testimony is clearly-!",
        "Ruby: Oh my god![p/][s/] What the hell [i]is[/i] that thing?",
        "Tyrion: U-[p/][s/]Um...",
        "Celeste: Tyrion![p/][s/] Get behind me!",
        "Gallery: A-[p/][s/]A monster![p/][s/] It's a monster!",
        "Gallery: Someone call the Inquisition,[p/][s/] t-[p/][s/]the Kingsguard,[p/][s/] a-[p/][s/]anyone!",
        "Tyrion: Your Honor![p/][s/] Can you [i]please[/i] restore order!",
        "Tyrion: ...Your Honor?",
        "MBeatrice: Yeah...[p/] He fled out the back door the moment he saw me.",
        "Ruby: I-[p/][s/]It can talk?!",
        "Gallery: I-[p/][s/]It's a demon![p/][s/] It must be!",
        "Gallery: It's just like the legends say!",
        "Tyrion: Can we [i]all[/i] just calm down?!",
        "It takes a while before you can get everyone in the room to settle down.",
        "Eventually,[p/] it was clear that the \"demon\" wasn't intent on harming anyone...[p/] At least not yet.",
        "The court ordered extra guards just in case.[p/] And you're eventually able to bring everyone back to the courtroom.",
        "Judge: Mr. Cuthbert![p/][s/] What is the meaning of this?!",
        "Tyrion: S-[p/][s/]Sorry...[p/] I didn't know it was a-...",
        "Tyrion: Actually...[p/] What [i]are[/i] you?",
        "Judge: Are you a d-[p/][s/]d-[p/][s/]d-[p/][s/]demon?!",
        "MBeatrice: Why, yes.[p/] *laugh*[p/] I [i]am[/i] a d-[p/]d-[p/]d-[p/]demon.",
        "Gallery: Demons actually exist?!",
        "Gallery: I thought they were only a legend...!",
        "Tyrion: Your Honor![p/] Not only [i]do[/i] demons exist,[p/] the defendant has made one into her familiar.",
        "Tyrion: She's only blind in the literal sense![p/][s/] She's constantly looking through the eyes of her familiar to see!",
        "Ruby: ...And?",
        "Tyrion: What do you mean \"and\"?!",
        "Tyrion: It's pretty obvious that making a pact with a [i]demon[/i] is incriminating by itself.",
        "Ruby: Tell me, Your Honor.[p/] Do the laws of Wyverngarde prohibit entering an accord with a demon?",
        "Judge: T-[p/][s/]They don't,[p/] but-.",
        "Ruby: Then my client has committed no crime.",
        "MBeatrice: Even so,[p/] I really would have preferred [i]not[/i] revealing Marrunath like that.",
        "Tyrion: \"Marrunath\".[p/] Is [i]that[/i] your name?",
        "MBeatrice: ...It is what most people call me.",
        "Tyrion: I suppose you have a point, Tymora.",
        "Tyrion: Having a demon as your familiar isn't technically illegal.",
        "Tyrion: However,[p/] this [i]does[/i] prove that the defendant had a way to commit the murder,[p/] all while under the eye of everyone in the Ballroom.",
        "Tyrion: She could have sent Marrunath upstairs to the Gallery and then had him steal the Sword of Spell Eating.",
        "Tyrion: After that,[p/] they would just need to traverse the vents into William's Study,[p/] just like Eugene did that night.",
        "Ruby: The fact that her familiar is a demon [i]proves[/i] that she couldn't have done that.",
        "Tyrion: ...What do you mean?",
        "Ruby: You saw how everyone reacted when they saw Marrunath's form.",
        "Ruby: A monkey may have raised some eyebrows.[p/] But someone [i]surely[/i] would have reported Marrunath if they saw him.",
        "Tyrion: Tymora.[p/] Your client is a master of [b]illusion[/b] magic.[p/] Can I assume that we'll find [b]Invisibility[/b] in her [b]Spell Compendium[/b]?",
        "Ruby: ...You might.",
        "Tyrion: And with the connection granted by [b]Familial Bond[/b],[p/] she could have cast this spell on him [i]regardless[/i] of where each of them was.",
        "Ruby: ...I'll admit that my client [i]does[/i] know how to cast [b]Invisibility[/b].",
        "Ruby: But your theory raises another question.[p/] Could my client [i]continue[/i] casting it unnoticed?",
        "Tyrion: \"[i]Continue[/i] casting it\"?",
        "Ruby: You'll understand once I go over the order of events that night.",
        "Ruby: At an unknown time,[p/] someone stole the Sword of Spell Eating from the Haroldson Gallery.",
        "Ruby: Due to the timing of this,[p/] I'll admit that it [i]would[/i] be logically consistent [i]if[/i] my client was the thief.",
        "Ruby: However,[p/] sometime later,[p/] my client met with the Crown Prince and was watched closely by the Kingsguard.",
        "Ruby: From witness accounts,[p/] [i]including[/i] yours,[p/] we know that this happened at 12:45 AM.",
        "Ruby: And since this time,[p/] my client didn't leave the Kingsguards' sight.",
        "Ruby: It was around this time that William Frega retreated into his study and locked the door.",
        "Ruby: He made a point of telling everyone that he didn't want to be disturbed.",
        "Ruby: Then at 1:03 AM,[p/] Lord Haroldson finally discovered that the Sword was stolen.",
        "Ruby: He reported the theft to the Kingsguard and they activated the lockdown system.",
        "Ruby: Shortly after the report,[p/] Laefe Frega tried to speak with her father about the theft.",
        "Ruby: William Frega reiterated that he did not want to be disturbed.",
        "Ruby: Laefe saw his face.[p/] And there weren't any traces of [b]illusion[/b] directly on his body.",
        "Ruby: This means that William Frega was still alive at this time.",
        "Ruby: Unbeknownst to everyone at the time,[p/] William Frega was attacked by the murderer at 3:12 AM.",
        "Ruby: This is confirmed not only by Jan Hughes's testimony.[p/] But also by the Autopsy Report.",
        "Ruby: Then at 3:26 AM,[p/] the Kingsguard found the Sword of Spell Eating in my client's old room.",
        "Ruby: The Kingsguard tried to arrest my client for this.[p/] But the Crown Prince told them to stand down.",
        "Ruby: Finally at 3:36 AM,[p/] the lockdown was lifted.",
        "Ruby: Jan Hughes reported what he heard.[p/] And that's when the Inquisition and the Kingsguard discovered the body.",
        "Ruby: The theft must have happened before 1:23 AM:[p/] when it was actually reported.",
        "Ruby: In order to keep Marrunath concealed at every step,[p/] my client would have needed to keep him invisible from 1:03 AM to 3:12 AM.",
        "Ruby: Not only that,[p/] she needed Marrunath to wield the Sword of Spell Eating to ignore the effects of the [b]Anti-Magic Fields[/b].",
        "Ruby: This means he would need to be invisible for more than an hour.",
        "Tyrion: What's your point?",
        "Ruby: My point is that [b]Invisibility[/b] has a duration of one hour.",
        "Ruby: I'll admit that my client [i]could[/i] have cast [b]Invisibility[/b] before she met with the Crown Prince.",
        "Ruby: But if she wanted to [i]keep[/i] Marrunath invisible,[p/] she would have needed to recast the spell at some point that night.",
        "Ruby: And as you know,[p/] my client couldn't have done so during that night without the Kingsguard noticing it.",
        "Tyrion: Your logic makes sense...",
        "Tyrion: But that can only mean that the defendant refreshed the [b]Invisibility[/b] [i]right[/i] in front of everyone watching.",
        "Judge: In front of the entire Kingsguard,[p/] the two princes,[p/] [i]and[/i] Lucio Steelwind?",
        "Tyrion: As unlikely as it is,[p/] it's the only conclusion I can come to.",
        "Ruby: I had a feeling you'd say that,[p/] which is why we have a witness who can confirm that Beatrice didn't perform any magic that night.",
        "Tyrion: ...A witness?",
        "Ruby: Your Honor.[p/] The defense would like to call Prince Alaric to the stand.",
        "Judge: I-[p/][s/]I...[p/] see.",
        "Judge: ...He would have certainly been close enough to notice the defendant casting magic.",
        "Judge: But wouldn't the [i]Crown[/i] Prince's testimony be more suitable?",
        "Ruby: Are you trying to say that Prince Alaric is unqualified to give proper testimony, Your Honor?",
        "Of course, he's saying that![p/][s/] The kid is seven years old!",
        "Judge: N-[p/][s/]No![p/][s/] Of course not!",
        "Judge: I-[p/][s/]Is the prince ready to testify?",
        "Grow a spine, for Lord's sake!",
        "Tyrion: Thank you for coming in, Prince Alaric.[p/] Could you please-?",
        "Alaric: Hold your tongue, knave!",
        "Alaric: You will speak when you are spoken to.",
        "Tyrion: ……",
        "Celeste: Oh, god...[p/] He sounds exactly like Miriam when we first met her...",
        "Honestly...[p/] he behaves exactly how you'd expect a prince of this rotten kingdom to act.",
        "Aster's the odd one out in this situation.[p/] It makes you wonder what made [i]him[/i] so down to earth.",
        "Judge: U-[p/][s/]Um...[p/] Your Highness.",
        "Judge: Mr. Cuthbert believes that the defendant used her magic while she was with you and the Crown Prince.",
        "Alaric: I already gave my statement to the instigators.",
        "Alaric: This man [i]dares[/i] to question my testimony?!",
        "Judge: Yes.[p/] He said it.[p/] Not me.",
        "Wow...[p/] The judge didn't even think twice about throwing you under.",
        "Alaric: But very well.[p/] If my testimony is required to strike down these redundant accusations,[p/] I will bestow it upon you.",
        "Tyrion: \"Redundant\"...?[p/] Don't you mean \"ridiculous\"?",
        "Judge: Mr. Cuthbert.[p/] Do [i]not[/i] dare to suppose what His Highness really means!",
        "Tyrion: ...His boots must be shining from all that licking you're doing.",
        "Judge: What was that?",
        "Tyrion: Nothing.",
        "Alaric: You think Lady Frega cast magic right in front of me?[p/] Don't be a serf!",
        "Alaric: She was under the careful watch of the Kingsguard,[p/] my brother,[p/] [i]and[/i] Lord Steelwind!",
        "Alaric: We conversed for the whole night and I didn't see her cast [i]any[/i] magic.",
        "Alaric: She's been through so much over the last few years...[p/] All because of her horrid father...",
        "Alaric: She'd never do something like this![p/][s/] You [i]and[/i] Lady Steelwind are just jealous!",
        "He seems really convinced that he didn't see anything.[p/] You doubt that he's [i]intentionally[/i] lying.",
        "Tyrion: Celeste.[p/] Usually when you cast [b]Detect Magic[/b],[p/] I can see magical energies overlaying your eyes.",
        "Celeste: Yeah,[p/] there's always a visible magical effect on the target when I cast a spell.",
        "Tyrion: But Marrunath was probably in another room.[p/] The Kingsguard wouldn't see the initial magical effect of [b]Invisibility[/b].",
        "Celeste: Even if there wasn't a visible effect in that room,[p/] she would have still needed to say the incantation and perform the gesture with her hands.",
        "Tyrion: Right...[p/] Like how you shout [b]Reperio Arcanum[/b] every time you scan a crime scene...",
        "Celeste: I don't [i]shout[/i] it.",
        "Anyways,[p/] she must have done the incantation and gesture at [i]some[/i] point during the night.",
        "Did she ever get an opportunity to conceal herself to do so?",
        "Alaric: You think Lady Frega cast magic right in front of me?[p/] Don't be a serf!",
        "He probably meant \"Don't be absurd\"...[p/] But there's not much to gain from correcting him.",
        "Tyrion: You may think the idea is absurd, Your Highness.[p/] But the defendant was clearly good at keeping secrets.",
        "Tyrion: She could have easily concealed her actions at some point during the night.",
        "Tyrion: A brief moment to say the incantation and perform the gesture would have been all she needed.",
        "Alaric: But I wasn't the only one watching her!",
        "Alaric: She was under the careful watch of the Kingsguard,[p/] my brother,[p/] [i]and[/i] Lord Steelwind!",
        "Tyrion: But would they have really noticed her casting one spell?",
        "Alaric: The Kingsguard are the most vigilant knights in the kingdom.",
        "Alaric: They are [i]trained[/i] to watch and counter a mage's spell.",
        "Tyrion: But the defendant needed to target someone who was in another area.",
        "Tyrion: There would be no visual indication that she was using magic.",
        "Alaric: But she would have still needed to perform the incantation and complete the gesture with her hands.",
        "He's pretty knowledgeable about the Arcane Arts.[p/] But as a prince of Wyverngarde,[p/] you suppose that's to be expected.",
        "Alaric: We conversed for the whole night and I didn't see her cast [i]any[/i] magic.",
        "Tyrion: If I recall correctly,[p/] you and your brother were with her until she was arrested for the murder.",
        "Tyrion: What did you speak about?",
        "Alaric: She told us stories about what she did while she was away.",
        "Alaric: She was researching something...[p/] I forgot what she said.[p/] Something about \"the old cult\".",
        "Tyrion: Do you mean \"the occult\"?",
        "Alaric: Yes.[p/] That's it.",
        "Alaric: She was researching ghosts and demons.",
        "Considering who her familiar is,[p/] her research must have paid off.",
        "Tyrion: Anyways,[p/] Your Highness,[p/] could you please add this to your testimony?",
        "Alaric: If I must.",
        "Alaric: She told me and my brother how \"the occult are a fascinating phenomena\".[p/] I didn't see her cast [i]any[/i] magic.",
        "Tyrion: Wouldn't saying \"the occult [i]is[/i] a fascinating phenomenon\" be more grammatically correct?",
        "Celeste: Come on, Tyrion...[p/] Don't be one of those guys that corrects other people's grammar.",
        "Alaric: Yeah...[p/] We all say things incongruently sometimes.",
        "You feel like he [i]might[/i] be projecting a little.",
        "Alaric: She's been through so much over the last few years...[p/] All because of her horrid father...",
        "Tyrion: You're clearly sympathetic to her situation.",
        "Tyrion: But you must have only been a toddler when she left five years ago.",
        "Alaric: My brother spoke of her a lot.[p/] He told me all about her.",
        "Alaric: I could tell from his face.[p/] He was really sad that she ran away.",
        "Even if it's not romantic,[p/] Aster clearly cares about her a lot.",
        "The prosecutor must have complicated feelings about that.",
        "Alaric: She'd never do something like this![p/][s/] You [i]and[/i] Lady Steelwind are just jealous!",
        "Tyrion: ...Well, I can't speak for Ms. Steelwind,[p/] but [i]I'm[/i] just trying to get to the truth.",
        "Alaric: Liar![p/][s/] You just hate her because she's a noble, don't you!",
        "Alaric: Lord von Sanctus told me all about you![p/][s/] You just want to lock nobles up because you're jealous of how much gold we have!",
        "So he speaks with von Sanctus frequently.",
        "That actually explains a lot about his personality...",
        "Player: Overflow",
        "Tyrion: Celeste.[p/] What do you usually need to do to cast a spell?",
        "Celeste: There are a lot of factors involved honestly...[p/] Stamina and focus are a big part of it.",
        "Tyrion: Assuming that she's in perfect condition,[p/] what's the bare minimum that she would need to do?",
        "Celeste: Well she would have to focus her magic,[p/] say the incantation,[p/] and perform the gesture with her hands.[p/] All at the same time.",
        "That [i]does[/i] sound pretty conspicuous...[p/] But she must have hidden it somehow.",
        "Player: Objection",
        "Player: Invisibility",
        "Player: Default",
        "Tyrion: 法官阁下！[p/][s/]证人的证言明显存在矛盾！",
        "Tyrion: And [i]this[/i] piece of evidence proves it!",
        "Judge: 卡斯伯特先生……我没看出来这两者有什么关系。",
        "Tyrion: 啊、[p/]哦……[p/] 好像是这样的。",
        "Player: Back",
        "To cast a spell a mage needs to speak an incantation.[p/] But there's nothing that says you can't say anything before or after it.",
        "Tyrion: Your Highness.[p/] According to your testimony,[p/] the defendant told you that \"The occult are a fascinating phenomena\".",
        "Tyrion: Is that exactly what she said?[p/] Word for word?",
        "Alaric: Yes.[p/] The stories she told us were quite interesting.",
        "Alaric: They really stuck a court with me.",
        "Tyrion: I see...",
        "Tyrion: Well, even [i]if[/i] they were interesting,[p/] your testimony proves that she [i]did[/i] cast the [b]Invisibility[/b] spell that night.",
        "Alaric: Are you deaf?![p/][s/] I already told you!",
        "Alaric: No one heard her say any incantations![p/][s/] Nor did they see her perform any gestures!",
        "Tyrion: Unfortunately,[p/] your testimony proves the contrary.",
        "Tyrion: Beatrice Frega said an incantation and performed a gesture right in front of you,[p/] all without anyone even knowing it.",
        "Alaric: ...What?",
        "Tyrion: Your Highness.[p/] There are two components required to cast [b]Invisibility[/b].",
        "Tyrion: First,[p/] the caster must speak the incantation \"[b]O-kult-arr-ae[/b]\" and clap both of their hands together.",
        "Tyrion: As I'm sure you noticed,[p/] the defendant has a habit of clapping both of her hands to calm herself.",
        "Tyrion: Now that I think about it,[p/] that habit must have come from constantly casting the spell.",
        "Tyrion: The defendant requires Marrunath to see.[p/] So she must constantly cast [b]Invisibility[/b] to keep him invisible.",
        "Ruby: Cuthbert.[p/] You may have an explanation for how she hid the gesture.",
        "Ruby: But she would've still needed to speak the incantation.",
        "Tyrion: However,[p/] she [i]did[/i] speak the incantation.[p/] The witness's testimony proves it.",
        "Alaric: What are you talking about?![p/][s/] I never said that she spoke [i]any[/i] incantation!",
        "Tyrion: Your Highness.[p/] The incantation for [b]Invisibility[/b] is \"[b]O-kult-arr-ae[/b]\".",
        "Tyrion: Now recall what you said in your testimony.",
        "Ruby: ……！",
        "Tyrion: She said,[p/] \"The [b]occult are a[/b] fascinating phenomena\".[p/] The pronunciation of that one phrase is identical to the incantation!",
        "Judge: I see...[p/] So she hid the incantation in her conversation.",
        "Tyrion: And because her target was a creature that was [i]outside[/i] of the Ballroom,[p/][s/] no one saw the magical effects.",
        "Tyrion: This means that Marrunath had the means to murder William Frega,[p/][s/] just as Eugene did!",
        "Ruby: Having the means is completely different from actually having done it, Cuthbert.",
        "Tyrion: Very few people had the ability to shatter the display case to steal the Sword of Spell Eating.",
        "Tyrion: And even fewer people had a familiar small enough to traverse the vents.",
        "Ruby: Which also makes Haroldson's familiar an equally likely suspect.",
        "Ruby: And unlike my [i]client's[/i] familiar,[p/] he admitted to breaking into William's Study that night.",
        "Tyrion: If your client's familiar is truly innocent,[p/] then why not have him testify before the court?",
        "Judge: I see...[p/][s/] Well, it's not as if he's the [i]first[/i] unprecedented witness we've had today.",
        "Judge: Is...[p/] Marrunath willing to testify, Ms. Tymora?",
        "You see Tymora deliberating with Beatrice and Marrunath.",
        "You can't hear what they're saying,[p/] but they're clearly in disagreement with each other.",
        "Marrunath in particular,[p/] seems to be the most vocal about his displeasure.",
        "Ruby: ……",
        "Ruby: Your Honor.[p/] Unfortunately,[p/] Marrunath is unwilling to testify.",
        "Tyrion: ...Why the change of heart?",
        "Ruby: My client's familiar may be a demon.[p/] But he's afforded the same rights as any other person.",
        "Ruby: He is not obligated to testify.",
        "You look at Marrunath and he's grinding his very sharp teeth together.",
        "For some reason,[p/] he appears to be looking at you with intense hatred.",
        "Why are they being so secretive all of a sudden, anyway?",
        "A witness can refuse to testify to avoid incriminating themselves.[p/] But a refusal to testify is suspicious in and of itself.",
        "Tymora had no issues with Beatrice taking the stand earlier.[p/] So why would she change her tune when it comes to Marrunath?",
        "And despite what she said,[p/] Marrunath seems like he disagrees with their decision the most...",
        "Is it possible that [i]he's[/i] the weakest link of the three of them?",
        "If so,[p/] he might be the key to implicating them.",
        "Harold: And according to the legends,[p/] demons take great pride in their ability to deceive and corrupt people.",
        "You wonder...",
        "Tyrion: I see.[p/] Marrunath is well within his right to refuse...[p/] if [i]that's[/i] what he truly wants.",
        "Ruby: It is...",
        "Tyrion: Well...[p/] I suppose it's for the best.[p/] I doubt he'd be able to corroborate your story at all.",
        "Marrunath grinds his teeth together.[p/] It sounds like metal grinding on metal.",
        "Tyrion: Considering his diminutive figure,[p/] I don't blame him for being a coward.",
        "Judge: M-[p/][s/]Mr. Cuthbert,[p/] could you please refrain from provoking the [i]literal[/i] demon?",
        "Tyrion: Oh, it's fine, Your Honor.[p/] He can't do anything without his master's word.",
        "Tyrion: And between him and the defendant,[p/] it's clear that [i]Beatrice[/i] is the brains of the operation.",
        "Marrunath: You shut your [i]filthy[/i] celestial mouth!",
        "Ruby: ...Marrunath?[p/] What are you doing...?",
        "Marrunath: I will not stand here and be insulted by a bloody [i]heavensborn[/i]!",
        "...\"Heavensborn\"?",
        "Marrunath: I am still within my contract.[p/][s/] And I will not flee from the likes of [i]him[/i]!",
        "Marrunath: You want my testimony?![p/][s/] I'll give you my god-damned testimony!",
        "Ruby: Y-[p/][s/]Your Honor![p/] My client does [i]not[/i] consent to having her familiar testify.",
        "Tyrion: Tymora.[p/] Didn't you say earlier that Marrunath is \"afforded the same rights as any other person\"?",
        "Tyrion: He has a right to refuse to testify.[p/] But only [i]he[/i] can decide if he wants to exercise it.",
        "Tyrion: ...And he's clearly intent on giving it.",
        "Ruby: ……",
        "Tyrion: So, Marrunath.[p/] Why don't you testify about what [i]you[/i] were doing on the night of the murder?",
        "Marrunath: ...Gladly.",
        "Marrunath: I provided sight to my keeper while she spoke with the princes.",
        "Marrunath: ...[p/][p/]I'll admit that she [i]did[/i] cast [b]Invisibility[/b] on me during their conversation.[p/] She needed to keep me hidden after all.",
        "Marrunath: ...[p/][p/]But I never left the room where my master was.",
        "Marrunath: ...[p/][p/]Nor did I steal the Sword of Spell Eating.",
        "Marrunath: You have nothing on me, heavensborn![p/][s/] ...[p/][p/]You don't even have proof that I entered William Frega's Study!",
        "Tyrion: Do you honestly expect us to take your word for it?",
        "Tyrion: Or do you have any evidence to support your alibi?",
        "Marrunath: I only speak the truth, heavensborn.",
        "Marrunath: ...[p/][p/]There were mages other than my keeper that could have stolen the Sword.",
        "Marrunath: And by your own admission,[p/] none of your witnesses [i]saw[/i] me on the night of the murder.",
        "Marrunath: The one lacking evidence is you.",
        "He has a point...[p/] You still need definitive proof that ties him to the murder.",
        "PRESENTING contradicting evidence might not be possible.",
        "However,[p/] he's clearly lying in his testimony.[p/] And there's something...[p/] strange about the way he's speaking.",
        "Why is he pausing so much?",
        "You're not seeing any thoughts through the Eye.[p/] But perhaps you can try to INTERPRET the meaning of his words.",
        "Marrunath: I provided sight to my keeper while she spoke with the princes.",
        "Tyrion: Is this something that you frequently do?",
        "Marrunath: Yes.[p/] My keeper's accident left her completely blind.",
        "Marrunath: She looks through my eyes to see her surroundings.",
        "Tyrion: And did she look through your eyes while she was with the princes?",
        "Marrunath: ...[p/][p/]Yes, she did.",
        "He took a bit of a pause before answering your question.",
        "Marrunath: ...[p/][p/]I'll admit that she [i]did[/i] cast [b]Invisibility[/b] on me during their conversation.[p/] She needed to keep me hidden after all.",
        "Tyrion: Wait...[p/] Does that mean she [i]normally[/i] casts [b]Invisibility[/b] every hour?",
        "Marrunath: My keeper is a powerful mage.[p/] And my pact with her has only made her stronger.",
        "Celeste: Wow...[p/] That's actually really impressive.",
        "Tyrion: Really?",
        "Celeste: Casting spells may look effortless.[p/] But continuously casting spells takes a lot of stamina out of the caster.",
        "Celeste: She must have a lot of stamina if she can cast a high-level [b]illusion[/b] every hour.",
        "Marrunath: ...[p/][p/]But I never left the room where my master was.",
        "Tyrion: And did your master leave the room while she was with the princes?",
        "Marrunath: No.[p/] ...[p/][p/]I'm sure you remember.[p/] My keeper was under the careful watch of the Kingsguard [i]and[/i] Lucio Steelwind.",
        "Tyrion: And you're maintaining that [i]you[/i] never left the Ballroom.",
        "Marrunath: ...[p/][p/]As I said,[p/] I never left the room where my master was.",
        "He has a habit of pausing before he responds to you...[p/] But it only happens sometimes...",
        "Is it some strange demon accent?[p/] ...Or is it something else?",
        "Marrunath: ...[p/][p/]Nor did I steal the Sword of Spell Eating.",
        "Tyrion: Beatrice was one of the few mages present that could shatter the glass.",
        "Marrunath: Yes.[p/] But being able to do something and [i]actually[/i] doing it are two different things.",
        "Ugh...[p/] He's right.[p/] You won't be able to convict Beatrice until you can connect Marrunath to the murder.",
        "But you have a feeling...[p/] [i]He's[/i] the one that's going to give it to you.",
        "Marrunath: You have nothing on me, heavensborn![p/][s/] ...[p/][p/]You don't even have proof that I entered William Frega's Study!",
        "Tyrion: ...Why do you keep calling me that?",
        "Marrunath: Oh...[p/] Does the heavensborn not know the nature of his blood?",
        "Your \"blood\"?[p/] Could he be referring to your mother?",
        "Tyrion: Wait...[p/] Do you [i]know[/i] where my abilities come from?!",

        "Tyrion: The Eyetaker...",
        "Eyetaker: From the sounds of it,[p/] you've already heard of me.",
        "Tyrion: ...Ms. Tymora.[p/] What is this...?",
        "Ruby: I-",
        "Eyetaker: My daughter Eris has told me all about your work prosecuting this case.",
        "She's his [i]daughter[/i]?!",
        "Eyetaker: But I have to say,[p/] I'm quite impressed.",
        "Eyetaker: Getting a [i]monkey[/i] to testify?[p/][s/] I don't think [i]I[/i] could even pull off a grift like that.",
        "Eyetaker: You've pretty much blown past my expectations.[p/] Why I-",
        "Tyrion: Get to the point.",
        "As soon as you interrupt him,[p/] you feel every person in the room tense up.",
        "You don't even need the Eye to know that your interruption put them on edge.",

        "Eyetaker: I'm a father myself, you know?",
        "Eris: ...",
        "Eyetaker: Anyways,[p/] I'll get straight to the point.",
        "Eyetaker: I have a certain interest in the outcome of this trial.",
        "Tyrion: ...What are you talking about?",
        "Eyetaker: Little Lady Frega has been a client of ours for a long time.",
        "Eyetaker: I've done quite a lot of favors for her.[p/] And the time has finally come for me to collect.",
        "Tyrion: Those debts that Steelwind mentioned...",
        "Eyetaker: They all belong to me.",
        "Eyetaker: But there's no need to worry.[p/] I know she's good for it.",
        "Eyetaker: That is...[p/] [i]if[/i] she can inherit House Frega.",
        "Tyrion: What...?",
        "Eyetaker: Tymora's a good attorney.[p/] Even [i]without[/i] my help.",
        "Eyetaker: If she's convicted,[p/] we could easily reduce her sentence by rubbing the right hands.",
        "Eyetaker: But, you see...[p/][s/] There's that pesky Slayer Rule.",
        "Eyetaker: The thing is, Cuthbert,[p/] I [i]need[/i] Beatrice Frega to be acquitted in the current trial.",
        "Tyrion: So [i]that's[/i] what this is about?[p/][s/] House Frega's gold?!",
        "Tyrion: That's why you helped her [i]murder[/i] William Frega?!",
        "Eyetaker: Please.[p/] My goals aren't nearly so short-sighted.",
        "Eyetaker: I have big plans.[p/] Not just for Beatrice but for this entire kingdom.",
        "Eyetaker: And I need House Frega for that.",
        "Tyrion: ...Just like you \"needed\" Justin Waye?",
        "Ruby: Tyrion!",
        "Eyetaker: Ah, Justin.[p/] It's really a shame what happened to him.",
        "Tyrion: Don't act so innocent...[p/][s/] He would have never tried to rob Dracogen if you didn't threaten him.",
        "Eyetaker: Is that so?",
        "Eyetaker: Do you think I just randomly showed up on his doorstep one day,[p/] demanding gold?",
        "Eyetaker: [i]He[/i] was the one who came to [i]me[/i] for help.",
        "Eyetaker: I just told him to pay back what he owed.",
        "Eyetaker: If he hadn't come to me,[p/] it would have been some other criminal.",
        "Tyrion: ……",
        "Eyetaker: But that's beside the point.[p/] Enough about what I wanted from Justin.",
        "Eyetaker: Let's talk about what I want from you.",
        "Tyrion: You want me to throw the case?",
        "Eyetaker: Ah, I love this kid![p/][s/] I don't have to beat around the bush with this one!",
        "Eyetaker: No one will doubt you.[p/] Especially considering the amount of work you put into this already.",
        "Eyetaker: You don't [i]need[/i] to do anything.",
        "Eyetaker: ...Just take a dive.",
        "Tyrion: And let someone [i]else[/i] take the fall?",
        "Tyrion: No matter [i]what[/i] happens,[p/] the court [i]will[/i] blame someone for this.",
        "Eyetaker: If it makes you feel better,[p/] I can assign Tymora to defend the old man [i]and[/i] his monkey.",
        "Eyetaker: That way everyone can come out of this unharmed.",
        "Eyetaker: Everyone wins.",
        "Tyrion: ...Except for the fact that a [i]murderer[/i] will be put in charge of House Frega.",
        "Eyetaker: Please.[p/] As if that's [i]any[/i] worse than the people in charge of the other noble houses.",
        "Eyetaker: If you recall,[p/] there's [i]already[/i] a murderer in charge of House von Sanctus.",
        "Tyrion: ……",
        "Eyetaker: They're [i]all[/i] dirty.[p/] You've seen it, haven't you?",
        "Eyetaker: They rig the system.[p/] They pay, threaten, or even kill people to get their way.",
        "Eyetaker: All we're doing is...[p/] leveling the playing field.",
        "Ruby: Tyrion,[p/] please.[p/] Just listen to him.",
        "Tyrion: How can you just go along with this?!",
        "Ruby: ...I told you a long time ago that there were certain parts of my job that I couldn't tell you about.",
        "Ruby: Well [i]this[/i] is it.[p/][s/] [i]This[/i] is what we need to do to beat them!",

        "Tyrion: And you used [i]him[/i] to do it![p/][s/] All so you could keep winning!",
        "Tyrion: You...[p/] [i]blackmailed[/i] Miriam, Ms. Tymora!",
        "Ruby: Oh, as if we should show [i]any[/i] pity for that spoiled princess!",
        "A dreadful thought just entered your mind.",

        "Tyrion: Was that-?!",
        "Ruby: I-[p/][s/]I didn't [i]know[/i] that's what they were planning!",
        "Eyetaker: Despite my confidence in Tymora's skills,[p/] I'm afraid there was too much riding on this to leave to chance.",
        "Eyetaker: You've got to make your own luck if you want to beat the system.",
        "Tyrion: How could you?![p/][s/] She almost died!",
        "Eyetaker: We never expected her to strain her injuries like that.",
        "Eyetaker: And we definitely didn't expect [i]you[/i] to take her place.",
        "Eyetaker: So believe me when I say,[p/] that I'm being [i]uncharacteristically[/i] reasonable right now.",
        "Tyrion: How...[p/][s/] How could you even [i]consider[/i] working with someone like him?!",
        "Eyetaker: Don't you think it's a little arrogant to judge her, Cuthbert?",
        "Tyrion: ...What?",
        "Eyetaker: You talk about defending people as if you two are even close to being equals.",
        "Eyetaker: But [i]she[/i] doesn't have the luxury of looking into people's minds,[p/] now does she?",
        "Tyrion: You...[p/][s/] You [i]told[/i] him about the Eye of Horus?!",
        "Ruby: I...",
        "Eyetaker: The future of magic is changing, kid.",
        "Eyetaker: Like I said before.[p/] I have big plans for this kingdom.[p/] And I also have big plans for [i]you[/i].",

        "Ruby: To be honest,[p/] I hate it as much as you do...",
        "Ruby: But whether you like it or not,[p/][s/] we [i]need[/i] their help!",
        "Tyrion: But this is-!",
        "Ruby: Think about every client you defended![p/][s/] Think of Celeste!",
        "Ruby: If you didn't have the Eye of Horus,[p/][s/] what would have happened to her?!",
        "Ruby: If even [i]one[/i] thing went differently,[p/][s/] Pierce would have gotten away and Celeste would have been executed!",
        "Ruby: You've taken chances and followed your instincts.[p/] And that's worked for you so far.",
        "Ruby: But what if it's not enough?[p/] What if the system is too corrupt for you to fight against next time?",
        "Ruby: With the Eyetaker's help,[p/] you'll never have to worry about that again.",

        "Tyrion: No.",

        "With one motion of his hand,[p/] every mercenary in the room draws their weapons.",

        "Eyetaker: What the-?![p/][s/] How did you get in here?!",
        "Celeste: My whole [i]job[/i] is keeping this guy safe.",

        "Mercenaries: ...Is that really her?",

        "Celeste: *sigh*[p/] That was close.",

        "Tyrion: Eris.[p/] I appreciate you vouching for us,[p/] but I'm not changing my mind about this.",
        "Eris: Oh, I'm well aware of that.[p/] Why do you think I intervened?",
        "Tyrion: O-[p/][s/]Oh.[p/] Well...[p/] thank you.",
        "Celeste: Is this really okay?[p/] Won't your dad be mad?",
        "Eris: I should be asking [i]Tyrion[/i] that same question.",

        "Tyrion: S-[p/][s/]She's not my-",
        "Eris: Isn't she, though?[p/] She lost any right to deny it the moment she took it upon herself to raise you.",
        "Tyrion: She only did that because I asked her to...[p/] It wasn't her choice.",
        "Eris: Oh, but it was.",
        "Eris: How old were you when your [i]real[/i] mother was executed?[p/] Ten years old?",
        "Celeste: Eris!",
        "Eris: Back then you barely [i]knew[/i] Tymora.[p/] It would be a stretch to even call her a family friend.",
        "Eris: She was the adult in that situation,[p/] and what did she do?",
        "Eris: She fed your anger and hatred for the nobility,[p/] instead of allowing you to process your grief healthily.",
        "Eris: Tymora took you away from your only friends and isolated you from society.",
        "Eris: She even homeschooled you, didn't she?",
        "Tyrion: T-[p/][s/]That's-!",
        "Eris: As a result,[p/] you never formed any other relationships.",
        "Eris: You made your first close friend at the age of twenty...[p/] And she was your [i]client[/i].",

        "Eris: From what I've seen today,[p/] you clearly have no idea who [i]Tymora[/i] is.",
        "Eris: Even with the Eye of Horus,[p/] you're clearly a terrible judge of character.",
        "Celeste: Eris![p/][s/] You're going way too far!",
        "Eris: To save you from more heartache,[p/] let me give you one last piece of advice.",
        "Eris leans in really close to you and begins to whisper into your ear.",
        "Eris: Do you honestly think Celeste will ever love you?",
        "Tyrion: ...W-[p/][s/]What?",
        "Eris: I'm sure you understand now.[p/] Tymora can only afford to pay her exorbitant salary because of my father.",
        "Eris: You've already burned that bridge.[p/] So where do you think the Crimson Demon will go when you can't afford her services anymore?",
        "Tyrion: N-[p/][s/]No...[p/] She's not-",
        "Eris: With Flinhart dead,[p/] she has to worry about her mother.",
        "Eris: Do you think she has the luxury of playing around with you for [i]free[/i]?",
        "Eris: Or did you actually think that she [i]enjoys[/i] spending time with you?",
        "Tyrion: I-",
        "Eris: Tyrion.[p/] You have to look at this rationally.",
        "Eris: Any support or affection that she's given you has only been to keep you as an employer.",
        "Tyrion: Y-[p/][s/]You seem to know a lot about these things.",
        "Celeste: I had to do a lot of networking when I was a mercenary.",
        "Celeste: Do you know how many times I had to charm a merchant into hiring me?",
        "Tyrion: W-[p/][s/]Why...[p/] are you doing this?",
        "Eris: Because I want to finally break you.",
        "Eris: I'm just trying to keep you from getting hurt.",
        "Eris: It may seem cruel.[p/] But you have to be realistic about these things.",
        "Eris: ...You trusted Tymora and she betrayed you.",
        "Eris: Try not to make the same mistake twice.",
        "Celeste didn't hear anything she said.[p/] But she seems to notice how it's affecting you.",

        "Celeste: Why would he need to use the Sword of Spell Eating at all?",
        "Tyrion: Because of [b]Familial Bond[/b],[p/] they can telepathically communicate with each other.",
        "Tyrion: Harold probably needed Eugene to hold the Sword so he could tell him exactly where to go.",
        "Tyrion: The Sword's magic affects anyone magically connected to the wielder.[p/] And [b]Familial Bond[/b] connects them magically.",
        "Tyrion: It makes sense now...[p/] Harold could have easily faked the robbery to take suspicion off of him.",

        "Liafal: Even so...[p/] She's not the type of person to trust her accomplice to stay quiet.",
        "Liafal: She'd find a way to carry out a plan herself.[p/] And she'd only employ someone else's help if she had full control of them.",
        "Laefe probably knows her better than you do.[p/] But you doubt that working alone would be possible with her condition.",

        "Tyrion: O-[p/][s/]Oh...",
        "Ruby: It was an...[p/] extremely unforeseen situation.[p/] And Steelwind clearly put you on the spot.",
        "Ruby: You felt pressured to do something and you made a rash decision.",
        "Ruby: But I'm sure the court will understand if you withdraw.",
        "Tyrion: Wait...[p/][s/] What?",
        "Ruby: Cuthbert.[p/] You're [i]not[/i] a prosecutor.[p/] You know that, right?",
        "Ruby: Didn't you become an attorney to [i]defend[/i] persecuted mages?",
        "Tyrion: B-[p/][s/]But Beatrice [i]is[/i] guilty.[p/] I [i]saw[/i] it!",
        "Ruby: I'm not going to argue about this again.",
        "Ruby: You are [i]going[/i] to withdraw.[p/] This is not up for discussion.",
        "You've always regarded and respected Ms. Tymora.[p/] And you suppose that's always made you deeply scared of disappointing her.",
        "Perhaps she's right...[p/] She knows more about what's going on than you do.[p/] And she's still your mentor.",
        "...",
        "You [i]want[/i] to believe that.[p/] You really do.",
        "But deep down,[p/] you know that this is wrong.",
        "Ms. Tymora may believe in Beatrice's innocence.[p/] But you can't just abandon this case and let her escape justice.",
        "Tyrion: 我、[p/][s/]我……",
        "Your hands are trembling.[p/] Why are you so scared right now?",
        "You know what you have to say but the words won't leave your mouth.",
        "Celeste: ……",
        "From behind you,[p/] you feel Celeste hold your trembling hand.",
        "It's warm and comforting...[p/] It's that same sensation you felt back then.",
        "Somehow you can feel it through her hand.[p/] It's as if she's silently telling you that you know what you have to do.",
        "Your anxiety fades and you take a deep breath.",
        "Tyrion: ...I'm not going to do that, Ms. Tymora.",
        "Ruby: ...What?",
        "Tyrion: You said it yourself.[p/] Our court system needs a defense attorney and a prosecutor of equal power to keep things fair.",
        "Ruby: T-[p/][s/]That's not what I-!",
        "Tyrion: I'm not going to withdraw.[p/] If you believe in Beatrice's innocence,[p/] and if you truly believe you're on the right side...",
        "Tyrion: ...Then prove it by beating me.",
        "Ruby: ……",
        "Ruby: ...Fine.[p/] Do what you want.[p/] But you're only going to make things harder for everyone.",
        "Celeste: ...Tyrion?!",
        "As soon as Ms. Tymora steps out of the room,[p/] your body drops to the floor.",
        "Whatever bravery you felt before got replaced with an extreme amount of fatigue.",
        "Tyrion: Scaled Lord...[p/] That's the first time I've ever spoken to her like that.",
        "Celeste: But you still did it.[p/] You stood your ground.",
        "Celeste: ...Figuratively,[p/] I mean...[p/] Right now, you're kind of just sitting on the floor.",
        "Tyrion: Yeah...[p/] I need to take a moment.[p/] Can we go back to the ballroom?"
