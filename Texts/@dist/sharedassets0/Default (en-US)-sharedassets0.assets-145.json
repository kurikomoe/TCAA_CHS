        "Aria: 卡斯伯特先生。[p/]你所谓的“直觉”并不能成为确凿的证据。",
        "Aria: 真不敢相信我还得跟你解释这个……",
        "Tyrion: 是、[p/]是哦……",
        "好吧，[p/]你不能直接说你看得到她的想法……",
        "TYRION: 伊努斯女士。[p/]你的想法背叛了你。",
        "VALENTINA: 什、[p/][s/]什么意思……？",
        "你找到那一条想法了。",
        "她们肯定做了什么……[p/] 但到底是什么呢……？",
        "那一定发生在怀特指挥官审问她们的时候。",
        "ARIA: 奥蒙负责记录了她们的证词。",
        "TYRION: 他有提到这两姐妹有什么行为吗？",
        "ARIA: 按他的说法，[p/]她们是有点奇怪的举动……[p/]但并没有多可疑。",
        "Tyrion: “奇怪的举动”……？",
        "ARIA: 他告诉我她们两个一直在询问时围着他“快速转圈圈”。",
        "TYRION: [i]这[/i]又是什么意思？",
        "ARIA: 我也不清楚。[p/]可能在发现同事被谋杀后，她们紧张到了极限。",
        "“快速地转圈圈”",
        "她的想法是这么说的，“还好我们是双胞胎”……",
        "也就是说她们这个“花招”如果[i]不是[/i]双胞胎就行不通……",
        "Player:瓦伦蒂娜 与瓦莱丽 交换了 位置",
        "Player: Fail",
        "不对……[p/]这对双胞胎肯定用了什么办法与弄了怀特指挥官。",
        "斯蒂尔文德硕果她们两个当时在“围着他快速转圈圈”。",
        "她们干嘛要那样做？",
        "当然了！[p/][s/]她们调换了位置！",
        "瓦伦蒂娜先去与第一个[b]法术汇编[/b]绑定！",
        "然后她假装成瓦莱丽去绑定第二个！",
        "怀特指挥官分不清她们两个人！",
        "TYRION: 伊努斯女士。[p/]有一件事我要确认一下。",
        "TYRION: 调查过程中，[p/]你和瓦莱丽两个人确实都绑定了各自的[b]法术汇编[/b]。",
        "Tyrion: 我说得对吗？",
        "VALENTINA: 对、[p/][s/]对的。[p/][s/]那个骑士全程[i]监督[/i]了的！",
        "TYRION: 他具体是怎么让你们实施的？",
        "TYRION: 你们是同时与各自的[b]法术汇编[/b]绑定的吗？",
        "TYRION: 或者说，你们在绑定一个后又绑定了另一个？",
        "VALENTINA: 啊、[p/][s/]啊？！[mind=\"不会吧！他怎么知道我们怎么做的？！\" /]",
        "ARIA: 我看不出来这两者有什么区别，卡斯伯特先生。",
        "JUDGE: 是的，[p/]我同意。",
        "JUDGE: 不论她们按什么顺序操作，[b]法术汇编[/b]的结果是一样的。",
        "TYRION: 法官阁下，可能您还没有注意到。",
        "TYRION: 瓦伦蒂娜·伊努斯和瓦莱丽·伊努斯是一对同卵双胞胎。",
        "Tyrion: [i]也就是说[/i]她们的外表几乎完全一致。",
        "TYRION: 如果怀特指挥官没有命令她们同时尝试绑定，[p/][s/]他有什么办法阻止这对双胞胎伪装成彼此呢？",
        "VALENTINA: ……！",
        "ARIA: 这只不过是无根据的猜想罢了。",
        "ARIA: 奥蒙可不会这么简单的工作都做不好。",
        "TYRION: 真的吗，斯蒂尔文德检察官？",
        "TYRION:你很难相信[i]怀特检察官[/i]会在这么简单的任务中失败吗？",
        "ARIA: ……",
        "VALENTINA: 等、[p/][s/]等一下呀！[p/][s/]这也太扯了！",
        "VALENTINA: 我们[i才没有[/i]欺骗裁判所！",

        "TYRION: 把你妹妹带过来，然后我们会让你们[i]两个[/i]同时绑定[b]法术汇编[/b]！",
        "VALENTINA: 不、[p/][s/]不行……[p/][s/]等一下！",
        "JUDGE: 注意法庭秩序！",
        "JUDGE: 很显然，除非验证辩方的主张，否则庭审无法继续。",
        "JUDGE: 法警！[p/][s/]把瓦莱丽·伊努斯护送到证人席，[p/]再送来两个未绑定的[b]法术汇编[/b]！",
        "VALERIE: ……",

        "JUDGE: 怎、[p/][s/]怎么了，斯蒂尔文德检察官？",
        "JUDGE: 你发现什么了？",
        "ARIA: ……",
        "ARIA: 我[i]发现[/i]怀特指挥官最近要找一个新工作……",
        "ARIA: *叹气*[p/]看起来辩方是正确的。",
        "ARIA: 瓦伦蒂娜·伊努斯确实不是法师……[p/]但是瓦莱丽·伊努斯是。",
        "ARIA: 还有，[p/]瓦莱丽·伊努斯的[b]法术汇编[/b]包括了[b]疗愈术[/b]这个魔法。",
        "ARIA: 这……[p/]使得辩方的主张完全合理。",
        "VALERIE: 拜、[p/][s/]拜托……[p/][s/]让我解释一下……",
        "ARIA: 我们应该让你解释一下[i]发生了什么[/i]吗？",
        "ARIA: 你是个没有注册的法师。",
        "ARIA: 而且你和你的姐姐用伪证让我们出丑。",
        "VALERIE: ……",
        "VALERIE: 您怎么会明白这是什么样的感受，斯蒂尔文德[i]小姐[/i]？",
        "ARIA: ……什么意思？",
        "VALERIE: 您觉得我们没有注意到你的姓氏吗？",
        "VALERIE: 您和我们并不一样。[p/]您[i]不必[/i]隐藏什么。",
        "ARIA: ……",
        "VALERIE: 无论如何……[p/]现在整个庭审已经有些失控了。",
        "VALERIE: 我之前没想到隐藏这一点会造成这么多问题。",
        "VALERIE: 而我也不会让其他人因为我被误判投狱，[p/]就算他[i]是[/i]一个死灵法师。",
        "VALERIE: ……请让我就我所见进行作证。",
        "VALERIE: 我将告诉你那天实际上发生了什么。",
        "JUDGE: ……很好。",
        "JUDGE: 但你要明白你的行为会招致对应的处理结果，证人。",
        "VALERIE: 是的……[p/]我明白……",
        "Valerie: 我姐姐和我当时走在从厨房到前厅的走廊上。",
        "Valerie: 然后我突然发现附近的教室里，教授倒在一片血泊之中。",
        "Valerie: 瓦伦蒂娜用通讯设备呼叫求助，我同时试着挽救教授。",
        "Valerie: 我看到她正在流血，[p/]所以我对她施放了[b]疗愈术[/b]来愈合伤口。",
        "Valerie: 但已经来不及了。[p/]我把她腹部的那个洞合上了，[p/]但她已经死亡。",
        "JUDGE: 她肚子上有一个洞？",
        "TYRION: 法官阁下。[p/]您能通过证词清楚地知道，[p/][b]死灵术[/b]的魔法痕迹是证人留下的，[p/]不是我的委托人。",
        "TYRION: 还有，[p/]很明显尸体上曾经有一处[i]明显l[/i]的伤口。",
        "JUDGE: 我、[p/][s/]我明白了……[p/]那么……",
        "他马上就会说出来。",
        "法官在没有找到明确凶手的情况下并不想下达判决。",
        "但他也没有选择，[p/]对华莱士的指控内容是他用[b]死灵术[/b]杀死了贝尔维瑟。",
        "按照瓦莱丽的证词，[p/]检方没有任何证据表明他有罪。",
        "JUDGE: ……",
        "JUDGE: *叹气*[p/]好吧。[p/]看起来本庭也没有理由继续本次审理。",
        "JUDGE: 依据新发现的事实，[p/]本法庭已经没有其他选择，我们只能发现华莱士·奈特格雷夫没有——",
        "ARIA: 我相信本次庭审忽略了刚才证词中的一个关键细节。",
        "TYRION: ……你指的是什么，斯蒂尔文德女士？",
        "ARIA: 我们重新检查一下证人的证词。",
        "Valerie: 瓦伦蒂娜用通讯设备呼叫求助，我同时试着挽救教授。",
        "Valerie: 我看到她正在流血，[p/]所以我对她施放了[b]疗愈术[/b]来愈合伤口。",
        "Valerie: 但已经来不及了。[p/]我把她腹部的那个洞合上了，[p/]但她已经死亡。",
        "ARIA: 瓦伦蒂娜·伊努斯使用的那个通讯设备会保存每次使用的时间日志。",
        "Aria: 从日志中，[p/]我们可以知道瓦伦蒂娜在下午3:04使用了这个设备。",
        "ARIA: 这已经是死亡时间后的一个小时了。",
        "TYRION: 你想用这条信息做什么？",
        "ARIA: 卡斯伯特先生。[p/]其实有一位在被害人尸体被发现前见到过她本人的目击者：简·休斯。",
        "ARIA: 他，[p/]与另一位证人一起，[p/]在贝尔维瑟的尸体被发现看到过她在走廊路过。",
        "JAN: 我当时正在打扫大厅。",
        "JAN: 贝尔维瑟撞到了一个花瓶……[p/]搞得满地都是碎片和泥土。",
        "JAN: 那大概是那对双胞胎发现尸体前20到30分钟时发生的。",
        "ARIA: 尸体被发现前的“20到30分钟”。",
        "ARIA: 你有发现不一致的地方吗，卡斯伯特先生？",
        "TYRION: ……！",
        "等等……[p/][s/]不该是这样的！",
        "贝尔维瑟在尸体被发现时已经死了不止[i]一小时[/i]了……",
        "简怎么能在她[i]死后[/i]半小时看到她？！",
        "ARIA: 我很好奇啊，卡斯伯特先生。",
        "ARIA: 怎样能使一具死尸到处行走呢?",
        "TYRION: 不……[p/]你不会是要说——！",
        "ARIA: 现在有不止一个证据指向一个死灵法师实施了这次犯罪。",
        "ARIA: 被告谋杀了被害人后还使用了[b]死灵术[/b]让她的尸体活动了！",
        "Gallery: 僵尸？！[p/][s/]还是在帝国学院[i]里[/i]创造出来的？！",
        "Gallery: 多么不道德！",
        "TYRION: 太荒谬了！[p/][s/]她被双胞胎发现的时候腹部可是有个洞！",
        "TYRION: 简·休斯肯定会注意到这一点！",
        "ARIA: [b]活化死尸[/b]可以停止血液流动。[p/]所以她不会在其他任何地方留下血迹。",
        "ARIA: 被告也熟练掌握[b]幻觉[/b]系法术。",
        "ARIA: 对他来说使用一个[b]幻觉[/b]魔法隐藏僵尸化贝尔维瑟的伤口也很简单。",
        "TYRION: 但其他人也可以轻易地使用[b]幻觉[/b]魔法把自己装扮成被害人。",
        "ARIA: 如果是那样的话，[p/]他们又怎么能把尸体移动到教室里？",
        "TYRION: ……",
        "JUDGE: 嗯……",
        "JUDGE: 斯蒂尔文德女士。[p/]如果你的主张是真实情况，[p/]那就意味着谋杀发生在其他的地方。",
        "JUDGE: 裁判所知道是哪里吗？",
        "ARIA: ……很遗憾，[p/]我们不知道。",
        "Tyrion: 那么检察官对我的委托人的指控仍然是错误的！",
        "Tyrion: 在没有其他证据的情况下，你不能判我的委托人有罪！",
        "JUDGE: 我同意卡斯伯特先生。",
        "JUDGE: 依据新发现的事实，[p/]本次庭审应当暂时中断。",
        "JUDGE: 我们将给执法部门时间来调查未知的情况。",
        "JUDGE: 此案的庭审程序将在明天一早继续进行。",
        "JUDGE: 休庭。",
        "CELESTE: 嘿……[p/]你感觉还好吗？",
        "被害者死后一个小时尸体被目击四处移动……",
        "那肯定不是贝尔维瑟本人……[p/]或者至少可以认为，[p/]那个时候她已经死了。",
        "所以到底发生了什么事情？",
        "CELESTE: 提利昂……？",
        "还有人使用了[b]幻觉[/b]魔法……[p/]也确实应该是这样。",
        "但具体使用了那种法术？",
        "有可能是[b]幻象伪装[/b]吗？",
        "CELESTE: 提利昂！",
        "TYRION: 啊……！[p/]怎么了……？",
        "CELESTE: 庭审结束后你都不说话。",
        "Celeste: 搞得我好担心……",
        "Tyrion: 抱、[p/]抱歉……[p/]我只是在推敲斯蒂尔文德那几句话。",
        "CELESTE: 你是说她的主张？",
        "CELESTE: 仔细想想，这还有点令人毛骨悚然……",
        "CELESTE: 你真的觉得有人把教授变成了僵尸吗？",
        "TYRION: 我觉得不是。[p/]检方的立证建立在一个明确的事实之上：",
        "TYRION: 华莱士是当时附近唯一一个高阶死灵法师。",
        "TYRION: 我们只能认为他是唯一一个能使用那一类魔法的人。",
        "CELESTE: 那她又怎么四处走动的……？",
        "TYRION: 我不知道……[p/]根本就说不通。",
        "TYRION: 很显然华莱士没有触碰过尸体。[p/]所以我们不用考虑高阶[b]死灵术[/b]有被使用的情形……",
        "CELESTE: 不论怎么说，[p/]有人使用了[b]幻觉[/b]魔法。",
        "CELESTE: 可是难道没有法术能创造一个自主活动的幻象，而不仅仅是一个伪装吗?",
        "TYRION: 嗯……[p/]这我确实不清楚……",
        "TYRION: 我们得找个知道这类魔法的人谈一谈。",
        "TYRION: ……",
        "TYRION: 等下……[p/]厄莉斯不是说过她一直在研习[b]幻觉[/b]魔法吗？",
        "TYRION: 如果那种事情办得到的话，她可能会告诉我们怎么实现。",
        "CELESTE: ……这个主意真的好吗？",
        "TYRION: 什么意思？",
        "CELESTE: 如果……[p/][s/][i]她就是[/i]制造那那个幻象的人呢？",
        "TYRION: 啊……？",
        "你又一次从她身上探测到恐惧的反应。",
        "TYRION: 塞莱斯特，你是不是……[p/]有点怕厄莉斯啊？",
        "CELESTE: 什、[p/][s/]什么呀？！[p/][s/]我、[p/][s/]我才没有……！",
        "TYRION: 我早上也发现了。",
        "TYRION: 她在附近的时候你总是很害怕。",
        "CELESTE: 噢、[p/][s/]啊。我以为我隐藏得还不错呢……",
        "CELESTE: ……",
        "CELESTE: 对不起，[p/]虽然这没有什么事实依据，[p/]但是……",
        "CELESTE: 这些年来，[p/]我一直以佣兵为生。",
        "CELESTE: 你如果从事那种职业，[p/]你就会培养出一种……[p/]感知危险的直觉。",
        "CELESTE: 你想活下来就必须要这么做。",
        "TYRION: 抱歉……[p/]我从没想过这一点。",
        "CELESTE: 提利昂。[p/]我与字面意义上的那些怪物战斗过，好不容易才捡回一条命。",
        "CELESTE: 但我靠近厄莉斯的时候，[p/]我觉得那些怪物与她相比甚至不值一提。",
        "CELESTE: 我就是有这种……[p/]感觉。[p/]就好像我站在一个根本没希望打败的捕食者面前。",
        "CELESTE: 不论什么时候，只要她一接近，我的每一个直觉都在告诉我快跑。",
        "TYRION: 真的吗……？[p/]但她看上去也没那么危险吧。",
        "CELESTE: 我、[p/]我知道……[p/]我想也可能只是我最近很焦虑或怎么样。",
        "CELESTE: 但[i]我[/i]比谁都清楚不要以貌取人。",
        "CELESTE: ……",
        "CELESTE: 对、[p/]对不起。[p/]忘掉我刚刚说的东西吧。",
        "CELESTE: 如果你觉得我们应该和她对话，[p/]那我们就应该去做。",
        "你不会低估塞莱斯特的直觉。",
        "她总是很可靠。[p/]而且如果厄莉斯能让[i]她[/i]感到恐惧，[p/]那一定意味着什么。",
        "但如果厄莉斯真的[i]有[/i]那么危险，[p/]那就更有理由和她谈谈了。",
        "TYRION: 但除开这个理由，[p/]还因为那个检察官说过这么几句话。",
        "ARIA: 卡斯伯特先生。[p/]其实有一位在被害人尸体被发现前见到过她本人的目击者：简·休斯。",
        "ARIA: 他，[p/]与另一位证人一起，[p/]在贝尔维瑟的尸体被发现看到过她在走廊路过。",
        "TYRION: 她这么说的，[p/]“与另一位证人一起”。",
        "TYRION: 也就是说当时还有另一个目击者看到贝尔维瑟正在走动。",
        "CELESTE: 你说得对……[p/]而且简应该不是那个最靠谱的目击者。",
        "CELESTE: 所以与另一个目击者谈谈可能对搞清楚事情经过有帮助。",
        "CELESTE: ……不过你觉得斯蒂尔文德会告诉我们谁是那个目击者吗？",
        "TYRION: 就这一点来说，[p/]我们试一下也没什么损失。",
        "但不管怎么说，[p/]你有很多事情要去做。",
        "那么，该从哪里开始呢？",
        "JUDGE: 现在就华莱士·奈特格雷夫一案继续审理。",
        "JUDGE: 我们先就昨日的诉讼情况进行回顾。",
        "JUDGE: 昨日已当庭证明，[b]死灵术[/b]的魔法痕迹很可能不是由被告造成的。",
        "JUDGE: 很有可能是一位目击证人在尝试[i]治愈[/i]被害人时使用了 [b]死灵术[/b]并留下魔法痕迹。",
        "JUDGE: 然而，[p/]被害人曾在推定死亡时间之后被目击到有正常活动。",
        "JUDGE: 目前只可以解释为是被告使用了[b]死灵术[/b]驱动了被害人的尸体。",
        "JUDGE: 这产生了一个新问题：[p/]即谋杀案究竟发生在[i]什么地方[/i]？",
        "JUDGE: 请问检方是否已经找到了这个问题的答案？",
        "ARIA: 基于几位目击者给出的证词，[p/]谋杀很可能发生在图书馆内。",
        "JUDGE: 这个说法令人在意……[p/]是什么让你作出结论的，斯蒂尔文德女士？",
        "ARIA: 首先，[p/]我提请法庭各位回忆一下，受害者在尸体被发现之前就曾被目击到。",
        "ARIA: 事情是从受害者与校长于大楼中心附近会面时开始的。",
        "Theodore: 我们约好在中午 12:00 见面。[p/]根据我当天的行程安排，[p/]这次会面持续了一个小时。",
        "Aria: 这个事实引出下一个证言：[p/]其证人是学院的一名学生。",
        "Aria: 而这名学生看到了被害人从走廊经过。",
        "Miriam: 我看到她从校长室出来。",
        "Miriam: 然后她向图书馆的方向走过去。",
        "Aria: 这意味着第一位目击者看到了贝尔维瑟离开校长室。",
        "Aria: 可以推测，[p/]这也发生在她的会面[i]之后[/i]。",
        "Aria: 也即[i]这次[/i]目击是在下午1点左右发生。",
        "Aria: 另一件事情是尸体被人发现，[p/]发生事件与瓦伦蒂娜·伊努斯联系安保相同。",
        "Valerie: 我突然发现在教室里，教授倒在一片血泊之中。",
        "Valerie: 瓦伦蒂娜用通讯设备呼叫求助，我同时试着挽救教授。",
        "Aria: 正如我们已经确认的，[p/]这件事发生在下午3:04。",
        "Aria: 然而真正有意义的是尸体被发现[i]之前[/i]发生的事情。",
        "Aria: 第二位目击证人，[p/]一位清洁工，[p/]在西翼走廊里见到了被害人。",
        "Jan: 贝尔维瑟撞到了一个花瓶……[p/]搞得满地都是碎片和泥土。",
        "Jan: 那大概是那对双胞胎发现尸体前20到30分钟时发生的。",
        "Aria: 这意味着那一次目击必然发生在下午 2:30 之后。",
        "Aria: 而[i]这[/i]也表示，被害人于下午1:00到2:30之间的位置在图书馆附近。",
        "Aria: 根据被告人的说法，[p/]这个时段他在图书馆里。",
        "Aria: 此外，[p/]死亡时间是下午2:07.",
        "Aria: 也就意味着休斯先生看到的是被害人的尸体。",
        "{0}",
        "JUDGE: 我明白了。[p/]你的推论非常充分，斯蒂尔文德女士。",
        "JUDGE: 你作为辩方有什么意见，卡斯伯特先生？",
        "TYRION: 法官阁下，检方的推论的确经过深思熟虑。",

        "ARIA: ……",
        "斯蒂尔文德的推论一定在某处有个漏洞……",

        "ORYM: I’m…[p/] standing right here.",

        "Tyrion: Her actions must be driven by paranoia.",

        "Tyrion: There’s only one reason why she wouldn’t utilize the Inquisition like she usually does.",

        "CELESTE: “Four Pillars”?",
