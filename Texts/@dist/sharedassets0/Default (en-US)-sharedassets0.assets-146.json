        "Judge: 受害者：[p/]贾斯汀·维耶，[p/]在炼油厂场地内将体重压在了一处维护不善的护栏上。",

        "Aria: 检方承认事故现场<u>可能</u>被人为破坏过。",
        "Aria: 然而，[p/]我们也认为本案中有几个因素被法庭忽视了。",
        "Aria: “众所周知，[p/]事故发生时，有几名证人在炼油厂现场。”",
        "Aria: 当时，港务长正在带领一位赞助商参观炼油厂。",
        "Aria: 莫苏里卡·都铎正在进行食品配送，并进入了炼油厂。",
        "Aria: 当然，[p/]受害者：[p/]贾斯汀·维耶显然也在场。",
        "Aria: 每一个在场的人，那晚都没有理由<u>出现在</u>炼油厂。",

        "你怀疑会有人敢阻碍王储殿下的去路。",
        "Aria: ……这可能是事实。[p/]但<u>贾斯汀·维耶</u>在货运部门工作，他<u>本不应该</u>出现在现场。",
        "Tyrion: 我已经和我的委托人核实过这一点。",
        "Tyrion: 受害者没有获得进入炼油厂的授权。",
        "Aria: 那是谁阻止了贾斯汀·维耶未经授权进入该区域？",
        "Aria: 阻止此类人员进入炼油厂难道不是被告的责任吗？",
        "Tyrion: 我的委托人不能为贾斯汀违反既定规定的行为负责。",

        "Aria: 把责任推到可能的破坏者身上，是本末倒置。",

        "难道不应该有什么措施阻止她进入那个区域吗？",

        "Mosourika: 我有点担心，于是……",
        "Mosourika: 我决定去炼油厂的主楼找他。",
        "Tyrion: 这有点奇怪啊，你还会去找他。",
        "Tyrion: 为什么不把食物托付给他的同事呢？",
        "Mosourika: 我有这么想过，[p/]但我希望亲自确认他没事。",

        "Mosourika: 如果他在上班中途离开，还是不太合适。",
        "Aria: 那你是<u>怎么</u>进入炼油厂的，都铎女士？",
        "Mosourika: 有一道通往大楼的魔法门，[p/]但它没有上锁。",
        "Tyrion: 你说“魔法门”，[p/]是指那是由奥术能源供应的门吗？",
        "Mosourika: 是……[p/]我的咖啡馆里也有一扇差不多的门。",
        "Mosourika: 但大楼的这一扇看起来更复杂。",
        "Tyrion: 为什么你和德拉科根公司需要魔法门？",
        "Mosourika: 我咖啡馆里的那扇会在我打烊时魔法般锁上。",
        "Mosourika: 我猜通往炼油厂建筑的那扇门也是一样的作用。",
        "Tyrion: 但那就意味着<u>存在</u>某种机制，能阻挡未获授权的人进入。",
        "Aria: ……而且毫无作用。",
        "Aria: 证人进入炼油厂时，没有遇到任何阻碍。",

        "Tyrion: 他计划抢劫的保险箱位于炼油厂建筑内，我的委托人的办公室里。",
        "Tyrion: 我有证人<u>亲眼看到</u>贾斯汀在事故发生的前一晚拿出了那些工具。",
        "Tyrion: 他显然已经计划好如何破坏任何挡在他和保险箱之间的锁。",
        "Tyrion: 这意味着<u>贾斯汀</u>完全有可能通过非法方式让炼油厂的门锁失效了。",
        "Celeste: 我们不会真的要把他们带进来，对吧？",

        "Mosourika: 等等……[p/]让我捋一捋思绪……",
        "Mosourika: 很多人都可以让锁失效。",
        "Mosourika: 可能一个员工犯懒了，用武力破坏了锁。",
        "Mosourika: 还有那位和莫里森女士一起的贵族，[p/]他是一名法师，完全可以用魔法做到。",
        "Mosourika: 也有可能是维护构造体。[p/]我曾看到它们在维护机器,[p/]也许是<u>它们</u>中的某一个破坏了锁。",

        "Tyrion: 如你所见，法官阁下。[p/]奥术构造体那时搬运的并不是什么机器。",
        "Tyrion: 那是一根修复之杖：[p/]一种注入[b]形变术[/b]魔法的奥术能源工具。",
        "Aria: [b]形变术[/b]魔法。",

        "Lloyd: 如果你想抹黑我的名字，[p/]<u>就应该</u>直接冲我来。",
        "Aria: ……冯·桑克图斯勋爵，[p/]我强烈建议不要这么做。",
        "Lloyd: 拜托。[p/]你觉得我像那个傻瓜皮尔斯吗？",
        "Lloyd: 辩方的理论可笑至极。[p/]而且我有几份证据可以轻松证明我的清白。",

        "Lloyd: <u>确实</u>有可能命令构造体去完成一系列复杂的任务。[p/]但这么做是不明智的。",
        "Tyrion: 这难道不是构造体设计中的一个巨大缺陷吗？",
        "Lloyd: 奥术能源只有这么大的能耐。",
        "Lloyd: 制造能响应口头指令的魔法物品已经够难的了。",
        "Lloyd: 但我们的魔法还不够先进，无法复制生物的常识。",
        "Lloyd: 奥术构造体仍然是一个了不起的发明。",
        "Lloyd: 如果想派给它们复杂的任务，你只要监督它们就够了。",
        "Tyrion: 尽管如此，[p/]你承认了那<u>是</u>有可能的。",
        "Lloyd: 是的，[p/]但是……",
        "Lloyd: 我肯定你在奈特格雷夫一案中也注意到了这一点。[p/]构造体在完成一长串任务时极易出错。",
        "Tyrion: 你是指西奥多·雷德蒙的构造体上所发生的事吗？",
        "Lloyd: 是的。",
        "Lloyd: 不用说，构建体的设计并不是为了协助谋杀。",
        "Lloyd: 但它们的设计也不是为了在无人监督的情况下执行这么长的任务清单。",
        "Lloyd: 雷德蒙的许多命令都远远超出了构造体的预期用途。",
        "Lloyd: 他命令构造体把尸体从一处运至另一处。",
        "Lloyd: 他甚至还命令构造体播放音频，好让它自己看起来像个人。",
        "Lloyd: 我想你知道最后是如何告终的。",
        "他是对的。[p/]构造体遇到了意料之外的情况，没能完成任务……",
        "作为构造体的创造者，[p/]冯·桑克图斯知道这种情况是不可避免的……",
        "所以他是怎么处理的？",

        "Lloyd: 我绝不会信任一个构造体在无人监督的情况下偷偷完成这样一套复杂精细的任务。",

        "Lloyd: 但我还没有到要用这么绝望的方法的地步。",
        "<u>确实</u>有道理。",
        "你猜他从没有想过事情会绕到他身上。",
        "如果塞莱斯特没有用[b]法术探测[/b]，[p/]没有人会知道炼油厂内有人用过魔法。",

        "里卡看到贾斯汀·维耶从护栏上<u>摔下去</u>，[p/]即使是冯·桑克图斯动了手脚破坏了它……",
        "Aria: 那么请赐教吧，卡斯伯特先生先生。",
        "Aria: 他们两人的证词怎么可能<u>同时</u>为真？",
        "Tyrion: 唔，[p/]我想只有一种可能的解释。",
        "Tyrion: 都铎女士和莫里森先生都看见<u>有人</u>掉下了走道。",
        "Tyrion: 但是都铎女士和莫里森先生看见的不是同一个人……",

        "第二个掉进桶里的人仍然下落不明……",
        "幸运的是，[p/]你不<u>需要</u>证明第二个人存在。",

        "Tyrion: [b]通信术[/b]通常只能以一个人为目标。[p/]但对于这个法术来说，奥术构造体可能不算<u>人</u>。",
        "Tyrion: 这样还会留下什么证据呢？",

        "Player: Fail",

        "Tyrion: 让我们从你的角度考虑一下。[p/]你那天为什么要那么做？",
        "Tyrion: 你明明知道<u>那</u>会指引我们找到你最终藏匿构造体的地方。",
        "Lloyd: ……",
        "Tyrion: 你的目的是在不被任何人发现的情况下，破坏炼油厂。",
        "Tyrion: 所以你会怎么处理构造体<u>和</u>被绑定的物体？",
        "他需要藏匿并且/或者破坏那个物体，这样才没有人能发现。",

        "Player: 证据 被扔进 装有活泼性液体的 桶里",
        "Player: Fail",
        "不……[p/]冯·桑克图斯需要一个万无一失的方法来处理证据。",
        "为了做到这一点，他要么销毁证据，要么把它藏在一个没人能找到的地方。",
        "有什么东西他能用来销毁或隐藏证据吗？",
        "Tyrion: 你用了那桶不稳定的液体！",
        "Lloyd: ……",

        "Celeste: ……但这不就意味着那个物品已经完全溶解了？",
        "Lloyd: ……正是如此。[p/]你可找不到任何物证。",
        "Tyrion: 这可不一定。",
        "Tyrion: 你把修复之杖扔进了桶里，[p/]而<u>它</u>没有完全溶解掉。",
        "Lloyd: ……什么？",
        "Tyrion: 在贾斯汀掉进桶里后，工人们迅速中和了液体。",
        "Lloyd: 什么？！[p/][s/]中和那种液体就会让它变得一文不值！",
        "Lloyd: 那么做会让德拉科根损失一大笔钱！",
        "Tyrion: 和你不同，冯·桑克图斯，[p/]我的委托人更看重工人的生命，而不是利润。",
        "Tyrion: 正因为如此，[p/]裁判所才能在桶里找到骨头和金属的碎片。",
        "……等等。[p/]修复之杖没有完全溶解……",
        "这意味着它几乎是和贾斯汀同时掉进桶里的。",
        "Tyrion: ……你是在破坏行为结束<u>后</u>，才把修复之杖扔进桶里的。",
        "Tyrion: 而且如果你想毁掉修复之杖，[p/]你就会把<u>所有</u>需要销毁的证据都毁掉。",
        "还有什么冯·桑克图斯要销毁掉的东西吗？",
        "Player: 奥术构造体",
        "Player: Fail",
        "不……[p/]冯·桑克图斯会想把任何能给他定罪的证据都销毁掉。",
        "还有什么可能把冯·桑克图斯和破坏行为联系起来？",
        "Tyrion: 你应该也把奥术构造体销毁了。",
        "Lloyd: 这、[p/][s/]这太荒唐了！[p/][s/]我、[p/]我……",
        "Lloyd: 斯蒂尔文德小姐！[p/][s/]为什么你不——？！",
        "Aria: ……我之前跟你说过，对吧？",
        "Aria: 我会尽我所能地辩护。[p/]但我不会为你伪造不在场证明。",
        "Tyrion: 你一定是命令构造体把<u>它自己</u>扔进桶里，来掩盖你破坏行为的魔法痕迹。",
        "Tyrion: ……",
        "一个像人类一样的机器把自己扔进了桶里……",
        "……这意味着任何看着走道的人都会见到这一幕！",
        "Tyrion: 就是这样！",
        "Tyrion: 那个<u>奥术构造体</u>就是阿斯特和莫里森看到掉进桶里的第二个“人”！",
        "Tyrion: <u>这就是</u>为什么我们没在里面找到除了贾斯汀之外其他来自于人身上的有机物质！",
        "Tyrion: 阿斯特和莫里森看到的第二个“身体”其实是一个奥术构造体！",

        "Tyrion: 等等……[p/]里卡很肯定她看见贾斯汀掉下了走道。",
        "Tyrion: 在她注意到阿斯特和莫里森后，[p/]他们看见构造体破坏护栏，掉进了桶里。",
        "Tyrion: 那是不是意味着构造体是在贾斯汀·维耶从走道上掉下去<u>之后</u>再处理自己的……？",
        "Tyrion: 你为什么要命令它那么做……？",
        "Lloyd: 因、[p/][s/]因为这一切根本就没发生过！",
        "Lloyd: 你的逻辑有问题！",
        "他开始紧张了……[p/]或许你应该试试使用强化之眼。",
        "……不。[p/]你现在还不需要。",
        "你马上就能弄明白这件事了。[p/]你能感觉到。",
        "所以，好好想一想。[p/]如果他用魔法看着构造体，[p/]他就一定看到了贾斯汀掉下去。",
        "而出于某种原因，[p/]他的反应是破坏护栏。",
        "他为什么会对看到的这一幕视而不见呢？",

        "他为什么要做那种事？",
        "Tyrion: ……这是因为你<u>想</u>让这件事看起来像一场事故。",
        "Tyrion: 也就是说这实际上<u>不是</u>事故。",
        "Lloyd: 噢、[p/][s/]噢，[p/][s/]现在你又指控我是<u>故意</u>谋杀受害者的？",
        "Lloyd: 我<u>怎么可能</u>那么做呢？",

        "Lloyd: 犯下谋杀罪会给我做的事招来不必要的关注。",
        "Tyrion: 但那些构造体<u>确实</u>有把挡路的人推开的习惯。",
        "Tyrion: 要是构造体把挡路的贾斯汀推开，[p/]导致他从护栏边上掉下去呢？",

        "It's just as you thought,[p/] but...",
        "What does this mean?!",
        "Tyrion: Morrison,[p/] I spoke with Mosourika about what she saw.",

        "Noah: Aye.[p/] That sounds about right.",
        "Tyrion: No, Morrison.[p/] It actually doesn't.",
        "Noah: What do you mean?",

        "Noah: ...What?",
        "Tyrion: Morrison.[p/] Mosourika came to you for help.",
        "Tyrion: This was in [i]reaction[/i] to seeing Justin fall off of the walkway.",
        "Tyrion: If that's true,[p/] then how could you have [i]possibly[/i] seen Justin fall off of the walkway again afterward?!",
        "Noah: I-[p/]I have no idea...",
        "Aria: Mr. Cuthbert,[p/] you're disputing the witness' testimony over a [i]minor[/i] detail.",
        "Aria: It's entirely possible that Mr. Morrison [i]or[/i] Ms. Tudor simply misremembered.",
        "Tyrion: I highly doubt that Morrison misremembered the order of what happened.",

        "Tyrion: The prosecution's case is based on the broken guard rail.",

        "Tyrion: The defense asserts that these three witness accounts [i]must[/i] be consistent with each other.",
        "Tyrion: Otherwise,[p/] this evidence is [i]not[/i] strong enough to find my client liable.",
        "Aria: Please.[p/] The break in the guard rail is [i]directly[/i] over the vat.",
        "Aria: [i]That[/i] is enough physical evidence.[p/] It proves that the victim fell in because the railing broke.",
        "Tyrion: How do we know that the guard rail wasn't broken by some other event?",

        "Judge: I'll admit that I also find the defense's assertion...[p/] dubious.",

        "Aria: ……",
        "Rika saw a lot less than Morrison and Aster did.[p/] [i]And[/i] her testimony was a lot less detailed.",

        "You would say that [i]your[/i] \"flow\" is the most disrupted right now...",
        "Tyrion: *Ahem*[p/] [i]Anyways[/i], Ms. Tudor,[p/] you were at the Aurinax Refinery on the night of the accident.",
        "Tyrion: And you witnessed the moment that the victim fell off of the walkway.[p/] Am I correct?",
        "Mosourika: Y-[p/]Yes.[p/] That's right.",
        "Tyrion: According to your statement,[p/] you ran up to Morrison [i]after[/i] you saw Justin fall off of the walkway.",
        "Tyrion: The problem is that there's a contradiction between both of your testimonies.",
        "Mosourika: T-[p/]There's a \"contradiction\"?!",
        "Tyrion: Morrison testified that he didn't see the victim fall into the vat until [i]after[/i] you approached him.",
        "Tyrion: This wouldn't make sense, though.",
        "Tyrion: You saw the victim fall off of the walkway before you ran up to Morrison.",

        "Tyrion: Please include every detail you can remember.",
        "Mosourika: Sure...",
        "Mosourika: I was at the refinery when I heard a strange sound from the walkway.",
        "Mosourika: When I looked to see what it was,[p/] I saw that Justin had tumbled over the guard rail.",
        "Mosourika: But he hadn't fallen into the vat yet.[p/] I saw him barely hanging onto the edge of the platform.",
        "Mosourika: I didn't know how to get to the walkway from there.[p/] So I looked for help on the grounds and found Mr. Morrison.",
        "Mosourika: He must have seen Justin lose his grip of the ledge and fall into the vat after that.",
        "Judge: So the victim didn't immediately fall into the vat.[p/] He was hanging onto the edge of the walkway.",
        "Judge: That [i]would[/i] explain how Mr. Morrison saw the victim fall into the vat after Ms. Tudor saw him fall off of the walkway.",

        "Mosourika: I'm not quite sure.",
        "Mosourika: If I had to guess,[p/] I'd say that it sounded like the sound of metal hitting metal.",
        "\"Metal hitting metal\"?",
        "The refinery walkway [i]is[/i] made out of metal.",
        "So perhaps the sound she heard was something metallic colliding with the walkway.",

        "Mosourika: When I looked to see what it was,[p/] I saw that Justin had tumbled over the walkway's guard rail.",
        "Tyrion: So [i]this[/i] was the moment that you saw Justin fall off of the walkway.",
        "Mosourika: Yeah...",
        "Tyrion: And you said that he fell [i]over[/i] the guard rail?",
        "Mosourika: I did...[p/] But I'm not sure how it happened.[p/] I think something caused him to lose his balance.",
        "Mosourika: He tumbled over the guard rail and fell right off of the walkway.",
        "Interesting...",
        "Tyrion: But that still doesn't explain why Morrison saw him fall [i]after[/i] you ran to him for help.",
        "Mosourika: Well, I [i]did[/i] see Justin fall from the walkway...",
        "Mosourika: But he hadn't fallen into the vat yet.[p/] I saw him barely hanging onto the edge of the platform.",
        "Tyrion: He was hanging onto the ledge?",

        "Mosourika: I assumed that if anyone was nearby,[p/] they'd immediately try to help him.",
        "Mosourika: I didn't know how to get to the walkway from there.[p/] So I looked around for help and found Mr. Morrison.",
        "Tyrion: And did you see another individual with him?",
        "Mosourika: Yeah...[p/] I did.",
        "Mosourika: I tried to explain to him and his friend what was going on.",
        "Mosourika: But they couldn't hear me over the machines.",
        "Hm...[p/] That [i]does[/i] match with the testimonies that he and Aster gave you.",
        "Mosourika: After that, he must have seen Justin lose his grip of the ledge and fall into the vat.",
        "Tyrion: Did you also see this moment?",

        "Mosourika: I was so busy trying to talk to Mr. Morrison that I didn't see it.",
