        "Judge: 起初，[p/]这个案件的事实看起来非常简单明了。",
        "Judge: 受害者：[p/]贾斯汀·维耶，[p/]在炼油厂场地内将体重压在了一处维护不善的护栏上。",

        "Judge: 即使有人可能破坏了护栏？",
        "Aria: 控方承认事故现场<u>可能</u>被人为破坏过。",
        "Aria: 然而，[p/]我们也认为本案中有几个因素被法庭忽视了。",
        "Aria: “众所周知，[p/]事故发生时，有几名证人在炼油厂现场。”",
        "Aria: 当时，港务长正在带领一位赞助商参观炼油厂。",

        "Aria: 当然，[p/]受害者：[p/]贾斯汀·维耶显然也在场。",
        "Aria: 每一个在场的人，那晚都没有理由<u>出现在</u>炼油厂。",

        "你怀疑会有人敢阻碍王储殿下的去路。",
        "Aria: ……这可能是事实。[p/]但<u>贾斯汀·维耶</u>在货运部门工作，他<u>本不应该</u>出现在现场。",
        "Tyrion: 我已经和我的委托人核实过这一点。",
        "Tyrion: 受害者没有获得进入炼油厂的授权。",
        "Aria: 那是谁阻止了贾斯汀·维耶未经授权进入该区域？",
        "Aria: 阻止此类人员进入炼油厂难道不是被告的责任吗？",
        "Tyrion: 我的委托人不能为贾斯汀违反既定规定的行为负责。",
        "Tyrion: 你当然不能让我的委托人对<u>破坏</u>护栏这件事负责。",
        "Aria:所谓的“破坏”在没有找到真正的罪犯之前，充其量只是一个假设。",

        "Aria: 把责任推到可能的破坏者身上，是本末倒置。",

        "难道不应该有什么措施阻止她进入那个区域吗？",

        "Tyrion: 这显然是一种由奥术能源驱动的安全门。",

        "Mosourika: 我有点担心，于是……",
        "Mosourika: 我决定去炼油厂的主楼找他。",
        "Tyrion: 这有点奇怪啊，你还会去找他。",
        "Tyrion: 为什么不把食物托付给他的同事呢？",
        "Mosourika: 我有这么想过，[p/]但我希望亲自确认他没事。",
        "Mosourika: 毕竟一开始<u>是</u>我帮他找的这个工作。",
        "Mosourika: 如果他在上班中途离开，还是不太合适。",
        "Aria: 那你是<u>怎么</u>进入炼油厂的，都铎女士？",
        "Mosourika: 有一道通往大楼的魔法门，[p/]但它没有上锁。",
        "Tyrion: 你说“魔法门”，[p/]是指那是由奥术能源供应的门吗？",
        "Mosourika: 是……[p/]我的咖啡馆里也有一扇差不多的门。",
        "Mosourika: 但大楼的这一扇看起来更复杂。",
        "Tyrion: 为什么你和德拉科根公司需要魔法门？",
        "Mosourika: 我咖啡馆里的那扇会在我打烊时魔法般锁上。",
        "Mosourika: 我猜通往炼油厂建筑的那扇门也是一样的作用。",
        "Tyrion: 但那就意味着<u>存在</u>某种机制，能阻挡未获授权的人进入。",
        "Aria: ……而且毫无作用。",
        "Aria: 证人进入炼油厂时，没有遇到任何阻碍。",

        "Mosourika:我猜德拉科根先生在上班时间还开着门……",
        "Aria: 这意味着，受害者能够进入炼油厂完全是德拉科根公司的过失。",

        "Aria: 你的委托人的疏忽让贾斯汀·维耶这样未获授权的人能够进入炼油厂。",

        "Tyrion: 你回想一下，[p/]证人进入炼油厂建筑，并且之后见到了贾斯汀·维耶。",

        "Aria: ……我不会深究你是<u>怎么</u>得到这条信息的，卡斯伯特先生。",
        "Aria: 但是<u>这</u>和失效的魔法锁有什么联系呢？",
        "Tyrion: 斯蒂尔文德女士，[p/]贾斯汀拥有一套工具，可以用来开启普通锁<u>和</u>魔法锁。",
        "Tyrion: 他计划抢劫的保险箱位于炼油厂建筑内被告的办公室里。",
        "Tyrion: 我有证人<u>亲眼看到</u>贾斯汀在事故发生的前一晚拿出了那些工具。",
        "Tyrion: 他显然已经计划好如何破坏任何挡在他和保险箱之间的锁。",

        "Mosourika: 可能一个员工犯懒了，用武力破坏了锁。",
        "Mosourika: 还有那位和莫里森女士一起的贵族，[p/]他是一名法师，完全可以用魔法做到。",

        "How did he account for the Constructs' error-prone logic?",
        "Lloyd: It [i]is[/i] possible to order a Construct to complete a complex list of tasks.[p/] But doing so is ill-advised.",
        "Tyrion: Is that not a massive flaw in the Construct's design?",
        "Lloyd: Artificery can only do so much.",
        "Lloyd: It's difficult enough to create magical items that respond to verbal commands.",
        "Lloyd: But our magic is still not advanced enough to replicate the common sense of a living creature.",
        "Lloyd: The Arcane Construct is still a marvelous invention.",
        "Lloyd: You merely need to supervise them if you give them complex tasks.",
        "Tyrion: But regardless,[p/] you admitted that it [i]is[/i] possible.",

        "Lloyd: I'm sure you observed this with the Nightgrave trial.[p/] Constructs are extremely prone to error when completing a long list of tasks.",
        "Tyrion: Are you referring to what happened with Theodore Redmond's Construct?",
        "Lloyd: I am.",
        "Lloyd: It goes without saying that the Constructs weren't designed to aid and abet murder.",
        "Lloyd: But they also weren't designed to carry out such a long list of tasks unsupervised.",

        "Tyrion: That's correct.",

        "Lloyd: Yes.[p/] I suppose I would.",

        "Lloyd: I would never trust a Construct to discreetly complete such an intricate set of tasks unsupervised.",

        "Luckily,[p/] you didn't [i]need[/i] to prove that this second person existed.",

        "Tyrion: You [i]could[/i] have communicated with your Construct at the meeting.",
        "Lloyd: By that logic,[p/][s/] I [i]could[/i] be the mastermind behind every crime that occurs in Aurinax!",

        "Tyrion: You only tried to sell your Constructs to Dracogen so that you could control him!",
        "Tyrion: You wouldn't have done that otherwise!",

        "Tyrion: [b]Send Message[/b] can normally only target a person.[p/] But Arcane Constructs probably don't count as [i]people[/i] for the purposes of that spell.",

        "Aria: Hypothetically,[p/] yes.",

        "Tyrion: Knowing [i]that[/i] will point us to where you ultimately hid the Construct.",
        "Lloyd: ...",
        "Tyrion: Your intention was to sabotage the refinery without anyone finding out what you did.",
        "Tyrion: So how would you dispose of the Construct [i]and[/i] the attuned item?",

        "Tyrion: The workers neutralized the liquid immediately after Justin fell into the vat.",
        "Lloyd: What?![p/][s/] Neutralizing that liquid would have rendered it unsalvageable and useless!",
        "Lloyd: Doing that would have cost Dracogen a small fortune!",
        "Tyrion: Unlike you, von Sanctus,[p/] my client values the lives of his workers over his profits.",
        "Tyrion: And because of that,[p/] the Inquisition was able to find pieces of bone matter and metal within the vat.",
        "...Wait.[p/] The Rod didn't fully dissolve...",
        "This means that it was thrown into the vat around the same time that Justin fell into it.",
        "Tyrion: ...You wouldn't have thrown the Rod into the vat until [i]after[/i] you were done with your sabotage.",
        "Tyrion: And if you wanted to destroy the Rod,[p/] you would have destroyed [i]all[/i] of the evidence that you needed to get rid of.",

        "Tyrion: No, Morrison.[p/] It actually doesn't.",
        "Noah: What do you mean?",
        "Tyrion: If Mosourika saw Justin fall [i]before[/i] she went to get help...",
        "Tyrion: Then how did [i]you[/i] see him fall [i]after[/i] she came to you for help?!",
        "Noah: ...What?",
        "Tyrion: Morrison.[p/] Mosourika came to you for help.",
        "Tyrion: This was in [i]reaction[/i] to seeing Justin fall off of the walkway.",
        "Tyrion: If that's true,[p/] then how could you have [i]possibly[/i] seen Justin fall off of the walkway again afterward?!",
        "Noah: I-[p/]I have no idea...",
        "Aria: Mr. Cuthbert,[p/] you're disputing the witness' testimony over a [i]minor[/i] detail.",
        "Aria: It's entirely possible that Mr. Morrison [i]or[/i] Ms. Tudor simply misremembered.",
        "Tyrion: I highly doubt that Morrison misremembered the order of what happened.",
        "Tyrion: His testimony matches up [i]exactly[/i] with the testimony of his companion.",
        "Aria: Then [i]Ms. Tudor[/i] must be the one who's mistaken.",
        "Judge: I'm compelled to agree with Ms. Steelwind.",
        "Judge: These conflicting accounts seem extremely minor.",
        "Tyrion: The prosecution's case is based on the broken guard rail.",
        "Tyrion: And only three individuals [i]witnessed[/i] Justin Waye break said guard rail.",
        "Tyrion: The defense asserts that these three witness accounts [i]must[/i] be consistent with each other.",
        "Tyrion: Otherwise,[p/] this evidence is [i]not[/i] strong enough to find my client liable.",
        "Aria: Please.[p/] The break in the guard rail is [i]directly[/i] over the vat.",
        "Aria: [i]That[/i] is enough physical evidence.[p/] It proves that the victim fell in because the railing broke.",
        "Tyrion: How do we know that the guard rail wasn't broken by some other event?",
        "Aria: That's ludicrous![p/][s/] You're clearly just playing devil's advocate!",
        "Judge: I'll admit that I also find the defense's assertion...[p/] dubious.",
        "Judge: However,[p/] I see no harm in allowing Ms. Tudor to testify to what she saw.",
        "Aria: ……",
        "Rika saw a lot less than Morrison and Aster did.[p/] [i]And[/i] her testimony was a lot less detailed.",
        "But the one detail she [i]did[/i] remember was that she saw Justin fall off of the walkway.",
        "Hopefully,[p/] her testimony might clear up what happened.",
        "Judge: Bailiff,[p/] please escort Ms. Tudor to the witness stand.",
        "Aria: Witness,[p/] please state your name and occupation for the courtroom.",
        "Hm...[p/] This is probably Rika's first time testifying in a courtroom.",
        "You hope she'll be okay...",
        "Mosourika: As if I need such introductions...[p/][s/] But allow me to indulge you all!",
        "Oh Lord,[p/][s/] is she seriously doing that [i]here[/i]?!",
        "Mosourika: [i]I[/i] am Mosourika Tudor:[p/][s/] Dark Lord of Aurinax,[p/][s/] High Archmagi of the Cadmium Flames,[p/][s/] and business proprietor of sweet confections!",
        "Judge: I-[p/][s/]I see![p/][s/] I was not aware we were in the presence of such a renowned individual.",
        "Wait...[p/][s/] Does he actually believe her?!",
        "Tyrion: Your Honor,[p/] Mosourika Tudor is the owner of a local café in Aurinax.",

        "You would say that [i]your[/i] \"flow\" is the most disrupted right now...",
        "Tyrion: *Ahem*[p/] [i]Anyways[/i], Ms. Tudor,[p/] you were at the Aurinax Refinery on the night of the accident.",
        "Tyrion: And you witnessed the moment that the victim fell off of the walkway.[p/] Am I correct?",
        "Mosourika: Y-[p/]Yes.[p/] That's right.",
        "Tyrion: According to your statement,[p/] you ran up to Morrison [i]after[/i] you saw Justin fall off of the walkway.",
        "Tyrion: The problem is that there's a contradiction between both of your testimonies.",
        "Mosourika: T-[p/]There's a \"contradiction\"?!",
        "Tyrion: Morrison testified that he didn't see the victim fall into the vat until [i]after[/i] you approached him.",
        "Tyrion: This wouldn't make sense, though.",
        "Tyrion: You saw the victim fall off of the walkway before you ran up to Morrison.",
        "Tyrion: Morrison couldn't have possibly seen the victim fall again [i]after[/i] that.",
        "Mosourika: ...",
        "Mosourika: Oh...[p/] I think I see what happened.",
        "Tyrion: You do?",
        "Mosourika: I think you're misunderstanding what I said before.",
        "Tyrion: ...I misunderstood you?",
        "Tyrion: If that's true,[p/] could you please testify to the court exactly what happened?",
        "Tyrion: Please include every detail you can remember.",
        "Mosourika: Sure...",
        "Mosourika: I was at the refinery when I heard a strange sound from the walkway.",
        "Mosourika: When I looked to see what it was,[p/] I saw that Justin had tumbled over the guard rail.",
        "Mosourika: But he hadn't fallen into the vat yet.[p/] I saw him barely hanging onto the edge of the platform.",
        "Mosourika: I didn't know how to get to the walkway from there.[p/] So I looked for help on the grounds and found Mr. Morrison.",
        "Mosourika: He must have seen Justin lose his grip of the ledge and fall into the vat after that.",
        "Judge: So the victim didn't immediately fall into the vat.[p/] He was hanging onto the edge of the walkway.",
        "Judge: That [i]would[/i] explain how Mr. Morrison saw the victim fall into the vat after Ms. Tudor saw him fall off of the walkway.",
        "Aria: ……",
        "Judge: In any case, Mr. Cuthbert,[p/] you may begin your cross-examination.",
        "Mosourika: I was at the refinery when I heard a strange sound from the walkway.",
        "Tyrion: What kind of sound did you hear?",
        "Mosourika: I'm not quite sure.",
        "Mosourika: If I had to guess,[p/] I'd say that it sounded like the sound of metal hitting metal.",
        "\"Metal hitting metal\"?",
        "The refinery walkway [i]is[/i] made out of metal.",
        "So perhaps the sound she heard was something metallic colliding with the walkway.",
        "Did something shake the walkway and make Justin lose his balance?",
        "Mosourika: When I looked to see what it was,[p/] I saw that Justin had tumbled over the walkway's guard rail.",
        "Tyrion: So [i]this[/i] was the moment that you saw Justin fall off of the walkway.",
        "Mosourika: Yeah...",
        "Tyrion: And you said that he fell [i]over[/i] the guard rail?",
        "Mosourika: I did...[p/] But I'm not sure how it happened.[p/] I think something caused him to lose his balance.",
        "Mosourika: He tumbled over the guard rail and fell right off of the walkway.",
        "Interesting...",
        "Tyrion: But that still doesn't explain why Morrison saw him fall [i]after[/i] you ran to him for help.",
        "Mosourika: Well, I [i]did[/i] see Justin fall from the walkway...",
        "Mosourika: But he hadn't fallen into the vat yet.[p/] I saw him barely hanging onto the edge of the platform.",
        "Tyrion: He was hanging onto the ledge?",
        "Tyrion: Was there anyone around to help him back up?",
        "Mosourika: I didn't see anyone around.[p/] But I really wasn't paying attention to that.",

        "Mosourika: I assumed that if anyone was nearby,[p/] they'd immediately try to help him.",
        "Mosourika: I didn't know how to get to the walkway from there.[p/] So I looked around for help and found Mr. Morrison.",
        "Tyrion: And did you see another individual with him?",
        "Mosourika: Yeah...[p/] I did.",
        "Mosourika: I tried to explain to him and his friend what was going on.",
        "Mosourika: But they couldn't hear me over the machines.",
        "Hm...[p/] That [i]does[/i] match with the testimonies that he and Aster gave you.",
        "Mosourika: After that, he must have seen Justin lose his grip of the ledge and fall into the vat.",
        "Tyrion: Did you also see this moment?",
        "Mosourika: No. [p/] I didn't.",
        "Mosourika: I was so busy trying to talk to Mr. Morrison that I didn't see it.",

        "Noah: She pointed at the walkway.[p/] And that's when we saw someone fall into the vat.",
        "Noah: By the time we could get them to stop the machines.[p/] It was too late.",
        "And then there's Aster's account of events.",
