They aren't anywhere else on the walkwayâ€¦\r\n\r\nA mage must have sabotaged the guard rail within the last 48 hours. They clearly intended for someone to break the rail and fall into the vat. \r\nTraces of <b>transmutation</b> were also found in several locations in the refinery. Every place where these traces were located, the surrounding machines and vats were rusted.\r",
