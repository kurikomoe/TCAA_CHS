    "original": "Lloyd von Sanctus personally sold several industrial tools to Stefanic Dracogen on behalf of Von Sanctus Industries. A lot of these tools were present in the Arcane Refinery. Von Sanctus Industries also created the security system for the Refinery.\r\n\r\nVon Sanctus attempted to sell Dracogen a few Arcane Constructs: a product that is not available to anyone else in Aurinax. However, Stefanic Dracogen did not trust the Constructsâ€™ ability to performs tasks effectively. He did not purchase any.\r",
