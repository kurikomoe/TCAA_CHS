However, they couldnâ€™t hear her over the noise produced by the refinery machines. \r\n\r\nThey noticed that Mosourika was pointing at the walkway, so they looked there. There, they saw a figure lean on a guard rail and break it. The figure fell from the walkway and into the vat of corrosive chemicals. \r\n",
