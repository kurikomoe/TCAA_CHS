I would've never contacted you unless I had no other choice. I know the truth behind McCoy's <i>true</i> parentage. And I'm aware of how vital this information is to you. As you know, my execution is scheduled for next month. And I'm running out of time. I want to trade this information with you. In exchange, you <i>will</i> grant me my freedom. Meet me within the private Prayer Room within the Grand Cathedral of the Scaled Lord at 2:00 PM. You <i>will</i> save me from my fate, or else”",
