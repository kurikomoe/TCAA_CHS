    "original": "At 2:00 PM, Aster de Wyverngarde went to pay his respects at his fatherâ€™s coffin. Unbeknownst to him, however, there was a <b>Glyph of Contingency</b> set to trap him inside a <b>Force Cage</b>. The trap triggered and Aster was trapped in that magical cage for its duration. Aster attempted to break the <b>Force Cage</b> by casting <b>Fire Bolt</b>. This created fresh traces of <b>evocation</b> which makes it impossible to tell when the <b>Glyph of Contingency</b> was placed.\n\nThere were traces of <b>illusion</b> magic at the crime scene. This might imply that someone hid themselves from the guards as they set this trap.",
