But when he asked Steelwind what was going on, she cast a <b>transmutation</b> spell on him.\n\n\nThis spell blurred his vision and put him in a daze. His ears were ringing, and he was unable to speak or walk properly. He could only move by crawling on the ground. Strangely, no one saw him while he was in this state.\n",
