    "original": "The Inquisition found a frozen blade impaling Garrick Pierce through his heart. There were traces of <b>transmutation</b> on his blood. This implies that the murderer used <b>Shape Liquid</b> to create this blade and murder him. Which is oddly similar to how Pierce murdered Flinhart McCoy.\r\n\r\nBut why would the murderer do this when they clearly had more lethal spells at their disposal? Pierce used this method during Flinhart’s murder to leave as little evidence as possible. However, it’s clear the murderer wanted to frame Aria and leave as <i>much</i> evidence as possible.\r",
