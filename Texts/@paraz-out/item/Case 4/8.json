    "original": "The Sword of Spell Eating is an ancient artifact. When wielded by a creature, that creature and anything connected to them (physically or magically) are immune to all harmful magical effects. Legends say that it was forged through a Blood Contract between a mage and a demon.\r\\n\r\\nOn the night of the murder, someone used a powerful spell to completely shatter the magically protected glass that was containing it. It was later found in Beatrice Frega's old room.\r",
