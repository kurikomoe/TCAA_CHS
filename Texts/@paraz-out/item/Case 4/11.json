    "original": "The Armbands of Intellect are an ancient artifact. When worn by a creature, that creatureâ€™s intelligence would be increased beyond the limits of an average human. Legends say that it was forged by a member of House Frega to further their study of magic.\r\\n\r\\nOn the night of the murder, Harold Haroldson discovered that the Armbands of Intellect were also stolen. The glass case holding the Armbands <i>wasn't</i> shattered. And the Armbands were replaced with a very convincing replica.\r",
