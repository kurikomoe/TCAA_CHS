After she left the meeting, she began heading to the Nave to meet with her father. However, she suddenly felt nauseous and went to the westward balcony. She lost consciousness soon after.\r\\n\r\\nShe later regained consciousness in the Prayer Room when she heard Celeste McCoy crying over your unconscious body. She did not cast ANY magic before she fell unconscious. \r",
