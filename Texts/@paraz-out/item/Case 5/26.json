    "original": "You saw Beatrice Frega as you were losing consciousness. You only saw her for a brief moment. So, it could have been an illusion. Regardless, that means that she somehow entered the Prayer Room at 2:30PM.\r\\n\r\\nA knight was assigned to guard Beatrice and kill her if Marrunath attempted to escape. He was later found comatose in front of the Prayer Room. Eris Illmater, who was also with Beatrice when she disappeared, has been missing since the massacre.\r",
