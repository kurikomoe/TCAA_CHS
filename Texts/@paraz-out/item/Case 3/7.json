    "original": "On the night of the accident, Mosourika Tudor frantically approached Noah Morrison and a man named Aster. She tried to tell them something. However, they couldn’t hear her over the noise produced by the refinery machines. \r\\n\r\\nThey noticed that Mosourika was pointing at the walkway, so they looked there. There, they saw a figure lean on a guard rail and break it. The figure fell from the walkway and into the vat of corrosive chemicals. \r\\n",
